I’m realizing my question is actually more specifically “Why does 2° matter so much when the temperature outside varies by far more than that every afternoon?”

I understand that it has impacts with the ocean and butterfly effects. I’m just not quite understanding *how* it’s so devastating, when 2° seems like such a small shift I would barely even feel it. Just from the nature of seasonal change, I’d think the world is able to cope with such minor degree shifts. 

It’s not like a human body where a tiny change becomes an uncomfortable fever. The world (seems?) more resilient than a body to substantial temperature changes, even from morning to afternoon. 

And no, I’m not a climate change denier. I’m trying to understand the details. Deniers, please find somewhere else to hang your hat. I am not on your team.

===========

**Proper Edit 2 and Ninja Edit 3**
I need to go to sleep. I wasn’t expecting this to get so many upvotes, but I’ve read every comment. Thank you to everyone! I will read new comments in the morning. 

Main things I’ve learned, based on Redditors’ comments, for those just joining:

* **Average global temp** is neither *local weather outside*, nor is it *weather on a particular day*. It is the *average weather for the year across the globe.* Unfortunately, this obscures the fact that the temp change is dramatically uneven across the world, making it seem like a relatively mild climate shift. Most things can handle 2° warmer local weather, since that happens every day, sometimes even from morning to afternoon. Many things can’t handle 2° warmer *average global weather.* They are not the same. For context, [here is an XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1732/) explaining that the avg global temp during the ice age 22,000 years ago (when the earth was frozen over) was just ~4° less than it is today. The ""little ice age"" was just ~1-2° colder than today. Each degree in avg global temp is substantial.

* While I'm sure it's useful for science purposes, it is unfortunate that we are using the metric of *average global temp*, since normal laypeople don't have experience with what that actually means. **This is what was confusing me.**

* The equator takes in most of the heat and shifts it upwards to the poles. The dramatic change in temp at the poles is actually what will cause most of the problems. It only takes a few degrees for ice to melt and cause snowball effects (pun intended) to the whole ecosystem. 

* Extreme weather changes, coastal cities being flooded, plants, insects, ocean acidity, and sealife will be the first effects. Mammals can regulate heat better, and humans can adapt. However, the impacts to those other items will screw up the whole food chain, making species go extinct or struggle to adapt when they otherwise could’ve. Eventually that all comes back to humans, as we are at the top of the food chain, and will be struggling to maintain our current farming crop yields (since plants would be affected). 

* The change in global average (not 2° local) can also make some current very hot but highly populated areas uninhabitable. Not everywhere has the temperatures of San Francisco or London. On the flip side, it's possible some currently icy areas will become habitable, though there is no guarantee that it will be fertile land.

* The issue is not the 2° warmer temp. It is that those 2° could be the tipping point at which it becomes a runaway train effect. Things like ice melting and releasing more methane, or plants struggling and absorbing less C02. The 2° difference can quickly become 20°. The 2° may be our event horizon. 

* Fewer plants means less oxygen for terrestrial life. [Precision Edit: I’m being told that [higher C02 is *better* for plants](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth), and our oxygen comes from ocean life. I’m still unclear on the details here.]

* A major part of the issue is the timing. It’s not just that it’s happening, it’s that it’s happens over tens of years instead of thousands. There’s no time for life to adapt to the new conditions. 

* We don’t actually know exactly what will happen because it’s impossible to predict, but we know that it will be a restructuring of life and the food chain. Life as we know it today is adapted to a particular climate and that is about to be upended. When the dust settles, Earth will go on. Humans might not. Earth has been warm before, but not when humans were set up to depend on farming the way we are today.",1

"ELI5: How does gravity make time slow down? Edit: So I asked this question last night on a whim, because I was curious, and I woke up to an astounding number of notifications, and an extra 5000 karma @___________@

I've tried to go through and read as many responses as I can, because holy shit this is so damn interesting, but I'm sure I'll miss a few.

***Thank you*** to everyone who has come here with something to explain, ask, add, or correct. I feel like I've learned a lot about something I've always loved, but had trouble understanding because, hell, I ain't no physicist :)

Edit 2: To elaborate. Many are saying things like time is a constant and cannot slow, and while that might be true, for the layman, the question being truly asked is how does gravity have an affect on how time is perceived, and of course, all the shenanigans that come with such phenomena.

I would also like to say, as much as I, and others, appreciate the answers and discussion happening, keep in mind that the goal is to explain a concept simply, however possible, right? Getting into semantics about what kind of relativity something falls under, while interesting and even auxiliary, is somewhat superfluous in trying to grasp the simpler details.

"ELI5: When did ""the customer is always right"" business model start, and why do we still use it despite the issues it causes? From a business standpoint, how exactly does it help your company more than a ""no BS"" policy would?

A customer is unreasonable and/or abusive, and makes a complaint. Despite evidence of the opposite (including cameras and other employee witnesses), why does HR or management always opt to punish the employee rather than ban the customer? Alternatively, why are abusive, destructive, or otherwise problem-causing customers given free stuff or discounts and invited to return to cause the same problems?

I don't know much about how things work on the HR side, but I feel like it takes more time, energy, and money to hire, train, write tax info for, and fire employees rather than to just ban or refuse to bend over backwards for an unreasonable customer. All you have to say is ""no"" and lose out on that $1000 or so that customer might bring every year rather than spend twice that much on a high turnover rate.

I know multibillion dollar companies are famous for this in the sense that they don't want to ""lose customers"", but there are plenty of mom and pop or independently owned stores that take a ""no BS"" policy with customers and still stand strong on the business end.

##Do trains get derailed by a stone or a coin on the track?
No, trains do net get derailed by stones on the tracks. That's mostly because trains are fucking heavy and move with such power that stones, coins, etc just get crushed!

##Why are train tracks filled with anything anyways?
* Distributes the weight of the track evenly
* Prevents water from getting into the ground » making it unstable
* Keeps the tracks in place

##Why stones and not any other option?
* Keeps out vegetation
* Stones are cheap
* Low maintenance

"ELI5: What is CBD Oil and how does it work? TLDR: CBD is a new medicine which is acting on the Endocannabinoid system. This is known to help treat Anxiety, sleep, mood, pain and much more. When buying CBD you have to make sure you source it from a reputable company which openly publishes lab reports on their website so you know EXACTLY what you are getting.


[I personally use Every Day Optimal and could not be happier with my results. You can visit their site by clicking here.](http://shopnow.everydaytincture.com)
&gt;CBD is one of 114 different cannabinoids that we currently know of. You may be familiar with THC, the component of marijuana known for getting users 'high'.

&gt;THC is the only cannabinoid we know of that gets you high. But all cannabinoids serve a purpose(s), some of which we know more about than others.

&gt;CBD is probably the second best known cannabinoid after THC. 2,400 HelloMD members were surveyed and it was found that they take CBD to help with 4 primary things: anxiety, depression, pain, and sleep.


&gt;82% of those surveyed said they found CBD to be very or extremely effective. 72% said it worked as well as or better for them than their prescription medication.


&gt;**But how?**

&gt;Our bodies have a biological system known as the Endocannabinoid System. It's found throughout our central and peripheral nervous systems, and it's made up of endocannabinoids (neurotransmitters), and endocannabinoid receptors (proteins). Endocannabinoids in the blood stream bind with the receptor proteins throughout the body. When these cannabinoids bind with the receptors, they produce unique effects in our physical and cognitive processes (thus, they are known as 'neuromodulators').


&gt;Sometimes cannabinoids are produced naturally in the body. Sometimes they enter the body in the food we eat. And certainly, they can also be introduced to the body via smoking of plant matter or consuming extracts from the two cannabis plants: hemp and marijuana.


&gt;Effects can be inhibitory or excitatory. Much of the effects depend on the presence and density of the receptors and where they are. In mice, receptors are bountiful in regions of the brain that control motor functions, so the introduction of cannabinoids to a rat's bloodstream often greatly impacts motor control.


&gt;Details of how individual cannabinoids affect humans is not as well known, as there hasn't been a lot of research on humans. But we do know that the ECS plays a major role in stress-response, sleep, mood, pain-response, and cognitive/physiological response to voluntary exercise, among other things.


&gt;We also know cannabinoids are more potent/effective when administered in unison, hence the common term in the CBD space: full-spectrum (indicating presence of all cannabinoids in the plant matter).


&gt;As an interesting side point, the ECS is majorly responsible for the ""runners high"" we experience after long, arduous exercise. In such cases, the body produces an endocannabinoid called anandamide, which creates feelings of euphoria, happiness, and well-being.

&gt;I'm an avid user of it for my flare ups of anxiety, and I swear by the use of it. Call me stupid or crazy I don't mind, I've done my research and really tried to find the right answer for myself. Now that CBD is legal in a lot of places it is really starting to show how powerful cannabinoids are.


I decided to go with[ Everyday Optimal CBD 1000mg](http://everydaytincture.com) based on my conversations and I couldn't be more pleased with the results! I immediately started feeling results. A few drops a day of it and I feel like completely different person. Thanks everybody!",1

"ELI5:Why do you get better for a few days after receiving a fatal dose of radiation? An excerpt from this excellent collection of photos: https://imgur.com/a/TwY6q 

""Once exposed, nausea and vomiting will begin almost immediately, and within a short space of time your tongue and eyes will swell, followed by the rest of your body. You’ll feel weakened, as if the strength has been drained from you. If you’ve received a high dose of direct exposure - as in this scenario - your skin will blanche dark red within moments, a phenomenon often called nuclear sunburn. An hour or two after exposure, you’ll gain a pounding headache, a fever and diarrhoea, after which you’ll go into shock and pass out.

After this initial bout of symptoms, **there’s often a latent period during which you’ll start to feel like you’re recovering**. The nausea will recede, along with some swelling, though other symptoms will remain. This latent period varies in duration from case to case, and of course it depends on the dose, but it can last a few days. It’s cruel because it gives you hope, only to then get much, much worse. The vomiting and diarrhoea will return, along with delirium. An unstoppable, excruciating pain seethes through your body, from the skin down to your bones, and you’ll bleed from your nose, mouth and rectum. Your hair will fall out; your skin will tear easily, crack and blister, and then slowly turn black.""",1

"ELI5: Is there a limit to how much a person can gain from a single cheat meal or day? I've never posted here before, so I'm sorry in advance if I mess up. 

My main question is this: How much fat can a person really gain from a cheat day? Is there an upper limit? It seems unlikely to me that if someone consumed 20 pounds worth of calories in addition to maintenance, that they would then actually gain that much in fat, but maybe I'm wrong. Is the upper limit just how many calories a person can manage? Or is there a limit to how much fat the human body can create in a particular window of time? Something else? 

I've read that a pound of fat is 'worth' 3500 calories. I just googled that to check if that's true, but I'm still not sure. That number is apparently from a 1958 study. Multiple sites call 3500 an oversimplification, or 'a general rule of thumb', but I don't understand why. That's not actually my main question, but it seems important to it.

I ask because I've been counting calories (5'5"", woman, 1200 calories a day, starting weight 188 pounds, current weight 135 pounds, goal weight 125 pounds) and I've been too nervous to try a cheat day. I don't want to reverse my progress, but I've also read that moderate cheat days can help with weight loss.

"Why isn't ELI5 participating in the Default Subreddit Shutdown? Explain Like I'm Five is **not** currently participating in the shut down. 

While we share many of the same frustrations that many other default subreddits have (namely, lack of communication and tools from the administrators to effectively moderate) this subreddit is, first and foremost, a place to learn.  We may not always achieve that goal, but we always try.

After significant internal discussion, we have come to the conclusion that our moral support for our fellow moderators does not overwhelm that goal. 

Do not take this to mean that we, as a team, are satisfied with the current status quo. Reddit, as an organization, has prioritized gimmicks (redditmade, snoovitars, redditnotes, etc) above creating better moderation tools, opening up lines of communication, etc, and this has not been to the advantage of the community as a whole.

While the specifics of the various moderation team complaints vary, the reality of the situation is that the discontent exists and is not addressed by the administration of this website.  If you are curious why a specific subreddit has shut down, we recommend visiting that subreddit and asking them. Most of them will have a link to their discussion page, like AskReddit, or you can send them a Moderator Message (you can do this by opening a new private message and typing the /r/[name of subreddit] into ""to"" field).

If you would like to support the moderators strike, we recommend messaging the administrators by visiting /r/reddit.com and messaging the moderators there.  If you would like to object to the moderators strike, we would recommend visiting the subreddit in question and following the link to their discussion subreddit or messaging them (you can do this by opening a new private message and typing the /r/[name of subreddit] into the ""to"" field).


Thank you, and we realize that we've removed a sticky on [Greek Financial Crisis](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3bi365/the_financial_crisis_in_greece/) in order to post this, but frankly the mod mails asking us to join, or why we weren't joining, are more easily addressed in a public format.

Edit: **As a note, there has been some confusion about the purpose of this ""going dark,"" to my knowledge none of the subreddits have gone dark in solidarity with any of the recently banned subreddits.  It has all been about Admin-Moderator communication.**

"ELI5: Why does light only penetrate 1000 meters of the ocean and not the entire ocean? I read that light is detectable at a depth of 1000 meters, but photosynthesis is only possible at 200 meters. The verbiage used by the article I read was ""significant light is only present at above 200 meters,"" but does ""significant"" mean the energy of the photons at that depth is diminished or simply that the frequency of photons hitting the sensors is decreased? 

Is photonic energy simply absorbed by the ocean to the point where photons can no longer exist? Or does the ""wave"" of light energy dissipate into the ocean like a sound or shockwave would? 

Moreover, are there other methods of gathering information through the medium of water that are more effective than light? For example, is the effective range of SONAR greater than that of, say, a light source? What about low wavelength vs high wavelength light?

Sorry if it seems like I'm asking for a 101 in photons and electromagnetic energy, never learned this stuff in physics.

"ELI5: Why do I read stories every few months about researchers developing amazing new battery technology but batteries still suck after so many years? Thanks everyone for the interesting comments. I learned a lot.

Summary of the answers:

*Current batteries are based on lithium-ion technology which was developed a very long time ago so it is now very mature. Mature technologies won't change that much more or get that much cheaper.

*Li-Ion battery technology has actually improved considerably in the past two decades. Progress has slowed recently.
http://i.imgur.com/NjvUGXh.png

*Modern smartphones and other consumer electronic devices also use a lot more power which cancels out the improvements in the battery.

*The trend in consumer electronics is towards smaller and thinner devices so the size of the battery must also be reduced. Smaller batteries hold less charge.

*New batteries based on more promising materials take a lot of time to go from the lab to a commercial product due to concerns about safety.

*Media often over states and hypes new battery developments.

Regardless of the surroundings they were stored in,  line dried seem to be more absorbent. Why is that?

I'm honestly amazed that so many people have such strong opinions about this.

Edit: re fabric softener. When I said I accounted for it when I asked this question,  I just meant that I normally add it to the rinse cycle in the wash, so the towels theoretically have them same amount on them regardless if I then line or machine dry the towels.

The main arguments seems to be: 

1) **If teeth didn't have nerve endings, we could hurt ourselves by trying to eat rocks or bone and not realizing how hard they are, and end up with broken teeth.**

If this ever was such a big problem, I wonder, why didn't our teeth evolve to repair themselves the way everything else from our skin to our bones do? Instead of having us live out the rest of our days in a constant state of agony.

I'm sure this horrible pain would make it harder to function and doing things like hunting or having sex would be out of the question.

I don't get why they need to use THAT much sugar. Wouldn't three spoonfuls do the trick? Yeah, there's more volume in a soft drinks can, but not by a huge margin (let's say 3 spoonfuls for a 200 ml cup of tea = about 5 for 330 ml = half the amount that goes into a can of coke). 

Before the Americans come in to tell me about high fructose corn syrup-Coke is still made with sugar over here.

EDIT: Thank you for all your interesting responses, I had never thought that this subject could raise such a debate. The ideas that colder beverages need more sugar than warm beverages, and that carbonation/caffeine make the drink so acidic as to require a 'sweetness counterbalance', seem like the best explanations to me but I can't honestly mark it 'Explained' because there doesn't seem to be any sort of consensus yet. However, I'll check back later. 

EDIT 2: Imma call this one explained. I think between you, you've given enough valid explanations to put a bow on this puppy. Well done, go Team Reddit! 

To the people asking ""who puts three spoonfuls of sugar in coffee?""-that's kind of the point. Three spoonfuls makes coffee undrinkably sweet (for myself and the majority of people at least), but not Coke. To the guy (apparently) calling me a conspiracy nut for asking a question about why Drink 1 is too sweet despite containing less sugar than Drink 2, all I have to say is ""What?"" (though, of course, we cannot rule out Illuminati involvement).",1

My limited layman's understanding of radiation is that ionizing radiation can penetrate and change the structure of atoms (by knocking out electrons) and therefore damage DNA, which is what a true ""radiation"" injury is, whereas the only known danger of non-ionizing radiation is heating damage (not a radiation injury).

However, the FDA article on microwaves linked below says: ""Most injuries related to microwave ovens are the result of heat-related burns . . . [and] are not radiation-related. That said, there have been very rare instances of radiation injury.""

How is radiation injury from microwaves possible if microwaves are non-ionizing?

"ELI5: Where does this ""neutron"" come from that splits U-235 / U-238 / PU-239 I have been reading about the fundamentals of elements / atoms in the context of fission just out of curiosity. I am starting to understand the basics, but lack the basic fundamental concept of where exactly this neutron comes from that splits the fissile atom creating energy + \~2 neutrons that continue the reaction in conjunction with a moderator such as   deuterium oxide, water, and graphite. BUT what I really do not understand is where this initial neutron comes from.

&amp;#x200B;

From my elementary understanding is during a normal nuclear reactor start (new reactor / all new fuel rods) or after a longtime shutdown, you need to have an appropriate neutron flux (spare neutrons). Therefore, using a start up source either (Californium-252 or combination of beryllium with Plutonium-238, americium-241, polonium-210, or radium 226)

&amp;#x200B;

But what I do not understand is how the neutron ends up going out on its own out of the nucleus of these elements? Is this just a basic phenomenon of physics/chemistry, where the neutron is stolen similarly to an electron by a fissile element?

&amp;#x200B;

Also why does the fuel assemblies / U-235 pellets, during transport / creation, not under go spontaneous fission causing generation of heat / chain reaction, if its enriched to a higher percentage and indeed undergoing fission spontaneously ?

After watching Niles Johnson's lecture, I still don't get the real-world relevance.

* What's the meaning of the Hopf Fibration or Hopf Planet?
* What new possibilities do they offer?
* Does it mean that the fourth-dimension is a possibility?
* What's the use and application of the Hopf Fibration?

"ELI5: How exactly are books (such as The Bible) copied onto DNA? I've often heard it said from R. Dawkins and George Church that this can be done similar to how you would with a CD, only with DNA My specific question comes from this:

http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/08/20/the-first-book-to-be-encoded-in-dna/

""Church and Kosuri took a computer file of Regenesis and converted it into binary code — strings of ones and zeroes. They then translated that code into the basic building blocks of DNA. “The 1s stand for adenine (A) or cytosine (C) and the zero for guanine (G) and thymine (T),” says Kosuri.  Using a computer program, this translation was simple.""

^Why would he include cytosine and thymine, wouldn't that just complicate the whole process since there are only two binary figures he needed to use? 

For example, say the computer file code was 0101010101. Wouldn't it be easier just to translate that to GAGAGAGAGA? Instead of something more complicated like GACTCAGTCT? 

I feel like the second way leaves room for a lot more mistakes

So, was he just trying to do something more impressive by incorporating all 4 base pairs instead of just two? Or is there a legitimately important reason to translate computer file binary code into all 4 base pairs?

"ELI5: How does fabric work? As in, going from say, raw cotton, to a cotton sheet or T-shirt I ended up going down a rabbit hole on this subject tonight, I've watched a bunch of ""how it's made"" episodes and similar things, and I feel like I get the overall process, but there are still parts I can't wrap my mind around.

Once cotton has been harvested, and had all the debris removed, it seems to be typically packed into a large bail.

Now, at this point, what you have is a gigantic bail of short hairs. I mean, an individual cotton fibre, hair, whatever you want to call it, is probably only a few inches long, right? And they're all tangled up at random.

I don't really understand how you go from that, to having a single long thread of cotton - like, the kind of thread you'd sew with. How do all those short hairs get combined into one long continuous thread, and how does the big mess of a bail get untangled into that?

And then, once you have a spool of thread.. I still don't fully grasp how you get from thread to fabric. I've looked up things on knitting, and sewing machines, and looms, and it still seems like black magic to me. You're basically making lots and lots of tiny little loops/knots into a grid, forming a 2D sheet, out of what is essentially a 1D line, right..?

I suppose what I don't get here is how it stays intact. Why, when you get say, a tiny rip in a cotton T-shirt, the whole thing doesn't just completely fall apart and unravel entirely back into thread. 

I found [this really cool image](https://www.cotton.org/journal/2008-12/3/images/Cover-12-3_1.jpg) of cotton fabric under a microscope, and I can see how it's all sort of held together with an under/over thing, basically each crossing trapping another piece of thread. But.. logically to me it seems that if you broke that at any point, the whole thing would just fall apart. And fabrics don't do that. You can maybe pull on a loose thread, but it stays mostly together even when cut.

I find this whole concept fascinating, but I also just sort of don't get it on a fundamental level, so I'd appreciate if anyone could break it down as an ELI5 for me :)",1

"How do you repair relations with crows? Story is relevant.

My neighbourhood has a lot of crows. Over twenty of them. They are generally on good terms with one another.

I watched them band together and kill one of the crows. They left its dead body in my yard. I waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because I don't want crow guts everywhere.

However, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. This brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. None of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

Now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time I am outside. Some swoop. They are becoming more and more aggressive.

Confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do I repair relations with these crows? I don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

Google is not helpful on this front at all. There is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.

"My brother died in a power line accident, did it hurt? My brother died in a work accident. His drilling rig hit a 12,250-volt overhead power line.

Anyway, would it hurt to die that way? 

He was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. Witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn’t able to make it to the truck for over an hour. 

I wanted to know if it was instant? Would it hurt? Did he burn alive? 

I told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn’t even know what happened, but reading online I don’t know if that’s true. 

I’m crying right now, it just sucks and I miss him terribly. 

Edit: For those asking, this accident happened last May. The emotions are raw and fresh again because Easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

I had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

With it coming up again, I just keep thinking why did I cancel? We could have had one last day with him but we didn’t. I want to go up this year, in his memory but I don’t know if I can.

She randomly calls me and I was like shit she sounds super young. I text her and ask if she’s 18. She said yes. Later she texts me and said she was lying.

This is dangerous. What can I do to notify her parents ?  It is an ATT number. Should I call them? 



Edit : I looked up the number on social media. Nothing. I reported it to tinder using their online form. 

She used fake pictures of course. I could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. I will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. I reported it to tinder and that’s all I will do. Some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. The second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) I hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. She revealed she was 10 while I was in the process of blocking the number. 

Even before she said she was under 18 I said absolutely zero things that wouldn’t be okay to say to a ten year old, so I know I’m in the clear. I believe there’s zero case to be made for any sort of enticing or anything like that. ",0

Also, I know rule 5 says no medical advice, but this seems less than ""How do I treat \_\_\_\_ disease"" and more of ""Everyone does this and I don't what should I do?"" I'm going to get vaccinated but it's more of a matter of where do I go to get vaccines.

Opened it and found a weird note inside with a bunch of numbers written with pencil. I have no idea what this is about but the next house is like 100 meters away from mine so I don't think that somebody simply mixed up the addresses or the cars.

"Was I sexually assaulted? If so, what should I do? For the past couple of months, I’ve been working in a restaurant. There’s this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she’s looking through my social media profiles, won’t stop snapping me or Facebooking me, I’ve since deleted her Snapchat and blocked her on Facebook. 

Anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. I moved my arm away to which she responded “don’t you like to be touched?” to which I responded “not by you”. So she went to kick me in the balls but I moved out of the way and said “no chance”. 

As we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. She moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which I pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. She said “I’m only joking” before trying to do it again IN FUCKING PLAIN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. All the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. The manager wasn’t present during this.

Anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said “dude, isn’t that basically sexual assault?” I responded “is it?” He said “man, she literally molested you and tried again” 

Honestly, I don’t know what to think. I am contemplating telling the manager but I feel she’ll laugh it off and class it as a joke because I’m a man. And no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn’t taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. Just think of it, if I had done that, I’d be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case.

So basically what the fuck do i do next? Im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. So if there’s an app or a website for that I’ll take recommendations.




Edit: im saved!! Well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. He works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won’t be until 5 or 6 am. Right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. Im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. This post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

Edit2: wow this blew up fast. I see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. I never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. I wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. Im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. I’m extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. As long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

A lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. I worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

A lot of people were recommending joining the military. I’ve considered the Navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)


((Edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo. Im very glad that there are many nice people here on reddit, but i would much rather you keep your money or use it for someone who needs it more than me. My situation isnt that bad. And again, thanks to everyone for all the advice",0

"What would happen if I squished an entire loaf of bread in a vice and ate the ensuing ""slice"" in a couple of bites? Would it expand in my stomach and would I become really full, or bloated, or sick? Or would it be just like eating a regular, albeit denser, slice and I would be fine?

Edit/update #1: This had almost 9k upvotes.  I said from maybe 2k upvotes that if this hit 10k, I would try it.  I have a vice ready to go (even though the surface area is tiny).  I am on a diet (and have a biggest loser competition at work), but I will definitely do this tomorrow, diet be damned.  I am still as curious as I was when it started.  I'll have my wife as a spotter to make sure I don't die.  I will probably use wonderbread since that is the consensus ""bread"", even though I feel like I should try multiple breads.  I'll probably post the link here, but I also need to know where I can post the youtube link as a follow up so everyone can watch this go down.  

I am equally psyched and afraid of what might happen, that is going to destroy my insides.  Let's do this!

PS. I will have this filmed and post it on youtube with links.  Not gonna be happy, but I will post video evidence whenever I can, maybe even the poopy (gross).

Update #2: I'll be buying bread later today and doing this. I'll post a link here to YouTube with the process. Two questions: What sub should I post it in, in addition to linking it here? And is there any free video editing software, for trimming any boring parts, or blurring anything out (in case I have like a letter with my name and address out and I realize after the fact)?

Thanks everyone! 

Update #3: I just completed the video recording of this and will be uploading it to YouTube shortly. I'll post the link here but I'll have to post a link to it in a new post somewhere too, I can't let this go to waste.

Update #4:  Okay, the video exists!  I didn't watch the entire thing, but I made sure it was full.  Please be gentle, this isn't r/roastme!  I posted it at the videos subreddit.

"Why are there so many popular right-wing ""dominant debaters"" (Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiunnapalosi), but left-wing counterparts seem nowhere to be found? Tl;Dr: The personality of an ""always right"", dominant debater, is common amongst several right-wing public figures, but I have trouble understanding why the same personality seems so scarce within left politics.

The whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that Steven Crowder guy from the meme). You see them debating hundreds of people and ""never being wrong""; although usually they're arguing less experienced people.

I'm not taking a political stance here, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

But I never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. Hell I can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

Again not in any way arguing for or against right wing/left wing. I don't think right wing argues with facts and left with feelings, thats just the result of the image Ben shapiro seems to commercialize",0
"Though the Disney Princess franchise is aimed at young girls, is it okay for me, a 17 year old boy to like them too? I never liked girly things up until December 2018 where I watched the movie, Ralph Breaks The Internet which has a scene that features all the princesses in their loungewear and I thought the concept was kind of cute, and over the following weeks, I went off to watch all the Disney Princess movies one by one until my interest in Disney Princesses grew in February 2019, where I went for a Chinese New Year family gathering at my aunt’s house and while waiting for the elevator, my favourite Niece and her Mother bumped into us, and my Mother told my Niece, “Hi, Caitlin! Did you know that your Uncle (me) likes Disney Princesses too?”      
  

During the gathering, I borrowed her mother’s phone to show my Niece some fan made Disney Princess comics that I found online a few days prior and really liked, and she liked them as much as I did. And this was also the day where I came up with the idea of forging all the Disney Princess autographs, as my Niece loved the Disney Princess autographs, as well as those of other Disney characters a lot, after I showed her YouTube video about them.   
   
It’s now coming to the end of May 2019, and my Disney Princess autograph forging skills have greatly improved since February, and I’ve been reading Disney Princess comics, though I’m just having doubts if this is “acceptable” given the number of adverse reactions I’ve gotten from people, usually along the lines that imply I shouldn’t have such an interest as it’s “girly” and how I’m a 17 year old boy who really likes them.
   
But would you say this is okay or not? Because I really like the franchise for the princesses, the movies and especially, the comics.",0

"A pigeon just laid an egg on my fucking bed and is always coming inside my room. So really quick background on this, I live in my apartment in an 11th-floor room and hence we have rooms with a small balcony on the corner. So there are this two pigeons (a couple I assume) and they are always sneaking into my room and then sits on the bed. I thought they were like dumb and would scatter them away. So some days later, I found a twig in my bed. AND then is when I realized that these birds want to fucking make a nest in my bed. So I then threw away the stick and shut the windows and the balcony to restrict them.

So things were kinda okay but then after coming home, I found that I forgot to close the windows and one of them came inside and is comfortably sitting on my bed. And also my bed was like full of clothes, 'cause I was too lazy to sort them out. I scared the pigeon away, but then I found an egg in my bed. IT FUCKING LAID AN EGG. Why are these birds so dumbasses? Man, also I live in an area with nature and trees around it and out of all those wonderful places, you had to pick my bed. I didn't throw the egg away or anything, that was morally wrong as I thought.  So I put out a pan with a rag on top of it and the placed the egg on it and kept it in the balcony.  But the bird is NOT coming to it and is again trying to sneak in the room. I placed the egg literally next to their sight and still, the mama bird ain't even sitting on top of it? So what am I gonna do? Will the egg not hatch if this goes on?

So is there any problem that if I touch the egg, the birb won't accept it or shit?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT; These things happened in a span of three weeks btw, so it first came to my room in the first week, I found a twig during the second week, and the egg in the end of the third week (just yesterday)

***EDIT*** \#4: Idk if anyone is here, but the bird laid two eggs as expected. So when I found the bird and the egg on my bed, I think it was gonna lay another egg but I scattered it away. And quick facts on pigeons on the way;

* Sometimes the mama and the papa bird may share the time sitting on the eggs
* Most often they egg two eggs, but not simultaneously (yeah I thought they laid two at the same time)

"So how exactly did the playboy mansion work? Did Hugh Hefner just hire attractive women to come in and live there? I don’t understand. Also why do some people hate Hugh Hefner so badly? I’m young (21 years) and maybe i missed when playboy was a big thing. I know what it is but i don’t know much about backstory. But even after looking it up i don’t get some things. 

So basically how did the playboy mansion work? So a bunch of hot girls were selected to live with Hugh Hefner for a selected amount of time and get paid for it? 

I saw a post in the “askwomen” sub and they were all about how Hugh Hefner is a gross misogynistic guy who exploited women with the playboy magazine. This confuses me because it was my understanding that he did not force women to do the things women did for playboy. IIRC these women in the playboy magazine and playboy mansion were consensually choosing to pose nude (which is not a bad thing: your body, your choice, do you) and be in the mansion. So why do some people hate Hugh so badly? Like what exactly did he do? And also how did the playboy mansion work?

"Why does everyone say not to pee in the shower? I fully understand not peeing while taking a bath, but what is the big deal about peeing in the shower? I have never in my life heard a single legit reason other than the obvious ""pee is gross so don't do it"".

You are under a constant stream of water and there's already dirt, soap, whatever else you may need to scrub off going down the drain and human urine is less harmful to the environment than some of the things that get washed down the drain. And we all know that water doesn't get recycled through your tank. 

The only other reason I've ever been given is ""girls shouldn't because it just runs down their leg and that's gross, especially since they probably just shaved their leg so all those pores are opened up"" which, personally, my first response was `??????????????????` and my second was `no`.

I will fight to the end for my right to pee in the shower and this world isn't strong enough to stop me, I will show no mercy as my fluids release under warm euphoric streams of life-giving aqua.

But for real I am genuinely curious from an educational standpoint.

Edit: I know it isn't totally clear but I'm specifically referring to private showers, not something like a locker room shower or other communal showers. Some folks in the comments have been nice enough to point this out as a more common reason for that to be spread as a standard.

"For real now, why the fuck would you film yourself doing a good deed (bonus points if it involves a disabled/elderly person)? With Christmas approaching, the amount of these videos has increased A LOT and there  isn't a single day I don't see a bunch of them here on Reddit. They have 30k+ upvotes, gold, platinum, people in the comments saying how amazing and super wow the whole thing is.

Is it just me who thinks this kinda shit is cringe and utterly pathetic? I mean ok, help people, do good deeds, be a nice person and so on, but the moment you record it/post it, the entire thing becomes just karma whoring.

EDIT

To address some of the comments:

1. Yes, the good deed still remains. That's nice. It would still remain without the recording too.

2. It will inspire others to do the same. Ok, imagine this: you're chilling on the couch, pondering if you should do a good deed today. You open Reddit and see a video of somebody helping sombody else, will that make you say ""damn, that's exactly what I needed to get my fucking ass up and do some good""? Do you go out and find the first homeless person and give them 10 dollars? Fuck no. People who want to do good don't need motivation, they just do it.

3. Maybe that disabled/elderly person who receives the gift doesn't want to be seen by millions of people online, especially if they are really poor or in a bad place in their lives at that moment. If they are disabled or elderly, they can't really run away from being filmed either, can't they? And I doubt that the posters actually ask for permission from the beneficiar like ""hey, can I put this on Reddit/any social media so people will see how happy you are cuz I helped you?""

4. By all means, people, do as much good as you can. The world really needs it. But do it because it's the right thing to do, not for Internet fame. I guarantee you, an anonymous good deed is worth much more than online appreciation. Merry Christmas to everybody! ",0

"Someone in my apartment building is smoking weed and it's coming into my unit through the ventilation somewhere, making everything I own smell like weed. My wife is in the military, so this is a huge fucking deal. There's a ventilation shaft in the utility closet with the water heater, right next to the door, which is also right next to the washer and dryer. Anyone outside of my door can smell the weed coming from the ventilation, and any time you walk into my apartment it's the first thing you smell. Being a military family and having our laundry smell like weed can get us both in really, really big trouble. Is there any way I can prevent this?  
  
It happens around 10 at night, clearly outside of the housing department's operating hours. This place was built in 2016, so it's pretty new.  
 
  
Edit: wow this blew up. I was not expecting that. Try to get back to the comments in the morning lol  
  
Edit 2: Thanks for all the responses, guys. Wasn't expecting this to be popular at all. Reading through most of the comments (and sorry I don't have time to reply to everyone!), I think my best temporary option is to try filtering the smell from the vent I think it's coming from as best as I can. If that doesn't work, I may try the ""positive air flow"" technique recommended by the thermodynamics stoner. A more long-term solution would be to contact housing if it continues to be a problem, as my only two concerns is that my apartment doesn't have a smell when I move out, and my wife's clothes don't smell like weed when she's at work.  
  
Reading through my lease agreement, I actually don't see anywhere that mentions drug use, or even smoking of any kind. Thinking back, the area around the demo room when we were being shown around before we signed a lease reeked of weed as well.  
  
Lastly, I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. I don't care if anyone else smokes weed. I was born and raised in Austin. I can probably count on one hand how many people I knew that didn't smoke weed in my 30 years living there. I just don't think my apartment needs to smell like that, you know?

"Is it weird to go to your childhood home and ask for a tour? A couple years ago I traveled 600 or so miles back to my hometown to see some friends and family.

We sat outside parked in front of the house debating whether or not to knock on the door and see if I could look at my old room and other little things I remembered about the house.

opinion 2: no it doesn't, he still has arms, one would assume he has a stomach and stuff in the bottom half of the round part which wouldn't be considered the head, decapitation would be cutting him across just above the arms, this would mean that Mikes eye is on his head, while his mouth is more on his torso, in addition, most creatures in the movie(s) come from a source of realism (eg. randall being a generic lizard, the mean lady being a slug, and the boss guy being a spider, and sully being some kind of bear or something if you count that) so it's fair to assume there's some kind of realism as to where Mike's stomach, kidneys, bladder, etc goes

And they are against gay marriage and interracial marriage. I'm Italian and my husband is super duper white. And they assume they are entitled to my life despite only being my foster parents for the last few years before my 18th birthday. Narrsistic people. Rude. Religious. 

Shout out to rasiedbynarrsitc and entitledparents subbreddit by the way.

Also these are the same people that firmly believe my gay was a phase. They sent my a gay-away camp. I ended up getting caned and two of my ribs are no longer attached to my rib cage due to the canning. They believe that the canning helped cure me and so it was a just beating. 

Btw I lived in America during this time, so please vote every November to end conversion camps.

So yeah. Seeing them mid July. What is the best way to tell them that I am still gay, happily married, and a proud dad?

"Are there areas in America that are so dangerous that Google hasn’t driven the street view car down them? I get it guys, turns out there IS such a thing as a stupid question. And apparently it’s “would anyone rob someone that’s driving a car with a giant 360 degree camera on it”.

Not gonna lie though, it’s been interesting seeing how many of you have zero idea of how bad some neighborhoods are in America and anyone who does must “get all their information from Fox News”. I guess when y’all google “deadly carjacking” or even “carjacking” google just shows an error message.

I’m also done trying to argue with people about it because they went down a bad neighborhood once and it was fine. It’s been fun guys, have a good one.

A final edit for anyone who lives in a city that I can find an article listing the most dangerous areas there that disagrees with me regarding how dangerous neighborhoods can be. If you drive down the street of my choosing going the speed limit and upload a video of it as proof, I’ll donate $10 to the charity of your choice (with a max of $100). Just comment on this post or private message me, and I’ll add your username up here. Once you upload the video I’ll also upload it as proof of me being wrong about violence happening to random passersby, and proof of the donation.

Edit: it’s going to need to be after 5 pm as well (if it’s like 4:45 I’m not going to split hairs though. I’m not trying to make people go after dark because that would be stacking the deck a little much).

Final edit (besides when I start posting donation proof tomorrow): I started thinking about it a little bit, and it just feels wrong to do this. I’m basically turning lower income areas into a zoo for people online to gawk at and for my own amusement. And based on ALL the street view pictures I saw while trying to find prime dangerous areas, nothing would happen. There was never anyone outside, and I believe all the videos would have proven that.

And even if something did happen, I paid someone $10 to be traumatized.

I appreciate everyone offering to go, and have messaged or replied to them all updating them on all of that. I asked that they tell me the charity of their choice and I will add it next to their name if they reply in the next 30-45 minutes.

"Everyday for the past few weeks, a lizard comes into my backyard and does push-ups for extended periods of time. sometimes literal hours pass and I come back to see him still doing it. Is this lizard gonna kick my ass someday? What is he doing?  I googled it and apparently it's to mark his territory, but I rarely ever see other lizards, and this dude is just doing it for a realllly long time. Can lizards have mental disorders or something? I'm so curious to know what he's doing at this point.

Edit: Okay so I took a video, he was eating ants, saw me, and then did (only one) pushup. I'm going to upload it and then go back outside to try to take a better video because usually he does pushups for 30+ minutes at a time. And sorry for recording with the phone upright. [Here is the video, part 1 (watch the second one this one is poorer quality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E56q020HeGw)

Edit 2: I DID IT. I caught a video of the lizard doing pushups again for about 15 seconds, not much compared to the hours he usually does but still, the fact that every time I see him he's doing pushups says enough. Uploading momentarily.

Some quick context: my mom wants to divorce my dad because he cheated on her 3 times and still does to this day but when she brings that up he gets crazy and insults her and hits her (not as hard to kill her or do some serious damage, but she still gets bruises). When he gets drunk he also gets really mad and does the same thing but this time he threatens me when I intervene.

"Why did my mom start laughing hysterically before she died? My mom just recently died of lung cancer. A couple hours after the ambulance brought her home for hospice, she was sleeping, when she tried to hop out of bed and sit in a chair. Then she tried to take all her clothes off. Which, I've read is all normal for end stages of life.

But what really got me was that when we got her back into bed, she just started laughing hysterically for like 5 minutes straight and then basically became unresponsive after that.

It was pretty disturbing. Probably more disturbing than when she evacuated her bowels, even, because at least I was told that would happen. I just can't get that broken laugh out of my head. I was wondering if that might be a symptom of hypoxia or something or if that's also a normal thing to happen at the end of one's life. I couldn't really find anything about it on the internet. And if I'm going to have flashbacks about it, I just kind of want an explanation or to know if anyone has experienced the same.

Edit: Thank you, everyone, for your explanations and your kindness. Fortunately, my original doctor and therapist from when I was in high school (when my mom first got sick) are in my insurance network again.

I have been neglecting my OCD, depression, and anxiety for years, but no more. I have a life to live.

When I got carded at the door, three different people checked my ID and then a cop came over and checked my ID and pulled me to the side and told me to fess up or I would go to jail.

He called some number on his phone and verified my ID was in fact accurate and apologized for the confusion.

My question is, how did my ID become fake all of a sudden?  I’ve used the same ID to get into bars and previous 18+ events and never had a problem.

"Is it lame to report a shoplifter? I was in CVS yesterday and I saw this punk-ass 16 year old looking kid stuffing things into his hoodie so I went up to the register and told one of the guys working there. The kid tried to walk out and the employee stopped him, took the stuff back, and let the kid leave and then thanked me profusely when I was checking out.  

I told my SO about it and she called me a narc and said I'm lame. Her logic was that CVS was a big corporation so they wouldn't notice a few dollars in stolen goods and it's possible the kid was trying to feed his family. I said instead of stealing maybe he should get a part time job and work to feed his family like everybody else (it's not like we live in Chicago, we live in a middle-class suburb of a very rich city). 

Am I a lame old man for reporting the kid?

**Edit**: Based on everybody's replies I can see that this is a controversial topic. Overall, however, with your help I've decided that what I did was not lame. To all those saying I should evaluate my relationship, SO, etc., it's not like she was seriously upset that I reported the kid, she was just teasing. 

**Edit 2**: I've read through all the top-level comments I've gotten so far and it is almost exactly a 50-50 split. This is crazy interesting. What I don't get most is the people who say, ""it doesn't affect you, it's none of your business, just let it be."" I suspect those are the same people who hear their neighbor beating their wife through the apartment walls and don't do anything because, ""it's none of my business."" 

**Edit 2.5**: I went back to buy some cookies and it looks like the only thing stealable in the area he was was either alcohol or powdered Kool-Aid/Tang mix. Let me restate, this was in the alcohol aisle so he could've stole that before I got there. Not necessities. 

**Edit 3**: Thank you /u/DeckhandFlout for providing the ultimate answer to this question which should settle it for everybody. ""Peter Parker decided to not stop a guy from stealing stuff. And look what happened there."" Always report thieves, if you don't they might kill your uncle. ",0

I am very depressed. I cry most days, I go to work and come home and don't really do much but stare at my wall, don't have any friends etc. 

I play with my dog a lot, take her on long walks, and take care of her because she doesn't need to suffer just because I do. But I can tell it makes her sad when I'm sad. She whimpers and tries to climb all over me and lick my face until I stop crying. I've tried to just smile a lot and use sweet voices to her but I can literally tell she is not buying it. She just ignores the toys I throw for her and treats and tries to comfort me instead. 

Is there something I can do to trick her? 

Edit: Thank you to all of you. You're all really supportive, understanding, and sweet human beings. I really appreciate it. Apparently you can't trick your dog so I'm just gonna try and do my best to get better for her. ",0

Also, so often they didn't report it or they didn't handle it properly from a criminal-investigator point of view; they went and showered right away or waited too long for evidence to be useful.

[Jump to cured update](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/79er2y/update_5_is_there_such_a_thing_as_overwashing/)

So about 5 months ago I made a post here asking for advice because my penis stank of fish. Like, really bad. Even when washing it with soap n scrubbing it it would not go away and at best be reduced for a few hours.
There's been a few developments since it was first diagnosed so here's a full update on the chronicles of stank dick:

I saw a doctor (Doc#1) she took a swab sample and it came back saying I have heavy growth of staphylococcus aureus and prescribed a short course of anti-biotics.
It began to clear up after 3 days, and by 6 it was more or less gone. It stayed gone for a week and then it came back in full force after another week.
I went to see a different doc (Doc#2) who called Doc1 a moron and gave me a much stronger course of anti-biotics.
The same deal happened, it went and came back. Saw Doc#3, who called Doc#1 &amp; Doc#2 morons for even prescribing antibiotics and said just stop using soap down there and it'll clear up because the soap is causing a imbalance of ~~fauna~~ flora there.
So I stop using soap and just focus on scrubbing it instead. Over 2 weeks it gradually improves, then starts to come back and reaches full force again pretty quickly.
Fed up, I go to a sexual health clinic since they'll know more about dicks i'd assume.

The nurse checks me over, and is a bit unsure what's going on. She brings in the head pecker-checker of the practice for a look.
He notices a mild redening which I didn't and says it's very typical of a male thrush infection. He says it's not very common but it happens that guys get it, and also says Doc#1&amp;2 are out of their mind to prescribe anti-biotics for it.
He goes on to say that Doc#3 had sort of the right idea, but i do need to use soap but just milder stuff that is un-perfumed.
He prescribes a 2 week course of Canesten anti-fungal cream, and also says to put of all things, salt under my foreskin.
He says these kinds of infections hate salt and it will kill them off.

So, i'm on day 4 of the cream and covering my dick in salt and so far so good. The smell went away practically immediately and was completely un-detectable by day 2. My dick also is super duper smooth feeling now which i haven't felt in ages so that's a good sign.
Here's hoping this is the end in trying to find the cure for stank-dick!

**TLDR:** Dick stinks **really** bad of fish, 3 docs failed to successfully treat it. Sexual health clinic says its Thrush and to cover my dick in salt and use anti-fungal cream for 2 weeks. So far so good, the results are the best yet.

**Edit** Thanks for the reddit gold! For those asking, the salt stings mildly for a minute after applying it. After that though you can't feel it. I think after just a couple of applications of salt followed by the cream after a few hours it has gone away completely. So i'll just stick to using cream for now for 2 weeks as recommended by the doc. The cream is Canesten (Clotrimazole) anti-fungal cream, which is over the counter at any pharmacy.
I applied the salt by putting some in a cup, wetting my finger, dipping it in the salt, then rubbing it on to the head, the underside of it, and the foreskin. Then just roll the foreskin back over the head and leave it there for a few hours/before bed before washing it off.",0

"Is this woman being trafficked? Not a throwaway, but fuck it.

I've noticed something odd on my way to work every morning. At the exact same time every morning (even weekends), there's a pair of people who catch my eye over by my work. It's a younger Hispanic female (mid-late 20s), who is followed by an older Caucasian male (early 50s) with sunglasses. The man is  always behind her, and has his hand on the woman's shoulder, such that it looks like he's pushing her down the sidewalk as they're walking. They'll stop, he hands her a bag on his shoulder, and they split up. They don't talk until they split up, and she always has the same neutral expression every morning. 

Something about it gives me the heebie-jeebies. Neither of them are dressed for working in an office, and they're walking from an area which is not residential. I thought he might be blind, but then they split up and went their own ways. I have a weird feeling that she might be a trafficking victim.

"Is there a reason to still use black text on white backgrounds? A trend that has been developing over the last year is the rise of dark modes across a wide range of apps and websites: more and more are giving the option of displaying white text over a dark background.

This made me think, why did we use black texts on white in the first place? I don't see the benefit of it, aside from the fact that before the internet the only comparison was pen and paper and thus I imagine people did not know how else to represent text.

However, listening to Post Malone's music now, it seems that all of it is basically just singing.

If you think about most rappers, most of their rapping is just saying the words over a beat, mostly non-melodically (e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prmQgSpV3fA).

"I found a stray dog while in vacation on the big island of Hawaii - what should I do? [Kohala’s gofundme page is now live for anyone wanting to help with her vet bills!](Https://www.gofundme.com/kohalas-vet-and-travel-expenses) 

UPDATE 3/28: [Here are some photos from Kohala’s first week in her new Seattle home!](https://imgur.com/a/orx6g) 
She’s settling in perfectly and I couldn’t be more pleased with how to other 2 dogs have welcomed her into the pack! The other female dog absolutely loves her and they’ve been spending a lot of time playing and snoozing together. Kohala is making fantastic progress on potty + crate training. She responds well to the LIMA training approach and very quickly figures out what I want her to do. She’s becoming more and more puppy like everyday and I’m so happy to see her coming out of her shell since her rescue. 

I want to thank everyone who has donated and shared her progress, especially those who have messaged me with kind words and support! With the help of everyone on Gofundme, she’s been able to get all of her veterinary care and is on an all natural puppy diet. I’ll be posting progress photos as she gains more weight :) 

VET UPDATE: We took her in to the vet and she had all of her vaccinations, dewormer, and microchip done. She’s not pregnant, just in heat. Obviously we’ll have her spayed at a later time when she isn’t in heat. The vet noticed that she has a weird injury on her front left leg that looks like an entry and exit wound. He thinks she may have been shot or impaled. She has pain medicine for the limp and if it doesn’t improve, we’re going to have her X-rayed when we’re back on the mainland. Overall, she’s looking good! Just need to fatten her up to a healthy weight. 

UPDATE: we called Kohala animal rescue and spoke to them. They said if we surrender her here she’ll be euthanized. They’re helping us with paper work and she’s our dog now! She’s coming home with us to Seattle! 

UPDATE #2: we named her Kohala after the area we found her in. She’s already cuddly and quirky and completely inseparable from us. We tried to set her up a bed in the garage, but she started crying when we walked away. We’re going to hide her in our room until we can find somewhere pet friendly to move to in the morning. Thank you to everyone for all your kind words and support!

My friend and I found this young dog in the middle of the rain forest on Hawaii and it’s obvious she’s been out here a long time. She’s extremely skinny, her tummy and vulva are swollen, so we think she may be pregnant or sick. She obviously needs to see a vet. We fed her a little bit of wet food and gave her some water and now we’re letting her rest while we figure out where to take her. Advice on how to best (and affordably) handle this situation is appreciated! Also, suggestions for other subs to post this in would be awesome! I may consider crowd funding to help with her vet bills if they’re more than I can handle, but I have never done it before. 

I’m here until Friday morning, then I leave for Seattle, WA. 

I’m also curious about what the process is like if I decide to keep her, and what would be required to have her transported to the mainland if anyone has any resources for that.

I'm just hoping before I come unglued assuming it's something else update: Apologies for the delay as a lot of you were asking for an update. It got really ugly and that is one reason I have not been able to make any updates. I confronted him about it and he lied naturally and said it wasn't his and it was his friends. I already knew that would happen, so I just tried to tell him that I was there to help and please don't lie to me. He got VERY upset and angry and left the house because I didn't believe him. My son is 20 years old, so he should be working anyway. We had to kick him out for not working so he has been homeless for a few months. I need to hold him accountable for his actions and that is what I am doing. Well he stayed gone for a week or two with minimal contact. Couch hopping or just going anywhere he could basically. Last night though he came over and asked for some food. I told him you cannot live here, but I will never let you go hungry. I let him in the house and clearly he is using still. I feed him and gave him a change of clothes and then he asks me for a ride about a mile away which I agreed. My car didnt have much gas so i decided to use my wifes car. Car is warming up and I tell him hang on and let me get my jacket. I go and get my jacket and come back and the car and my son are gone.  I was floored and shocked and angry. So many emotions at the same time.  I told my wife and she immediately thought it was in April Fools joke. ( well it wasn't ). I panicked so much and I wanted to call the cops and report it stolen naturally. Well I waited like 30 minutes thinking what to do. I did not call the cops for 2 reasons. 1 reason is yes he stole the car but once he has his life turned around it will be harder with a record. 2nd reason is  I was worried he would run if a police cruiser got behind him and he might be killed trying to get away. Well We did not have to wait long because we got a call about 90 minutes from CHP. He was about 10 miles down the road and wrecked the car into a ditch. He was ok thankfully and not hurt at all. I cannot say the same for my wifes car. Wheels are bent so might be broken axles...not sure. I am just glad he did not lose his life, that easily could have happened. We went to get the car towed back to the house and met the officer at the scene. He was in the back seat and did not want to talk to us. He got taken into jail for Grand Theft Auto and will see the judge Monday morning. Sucks bad because not only will he have a charge now, but the vehicle only had liability insurance  and I dont really have the money to put out for the damage and I don't know what to do.

"Where do autistic adults go? My brother is a 22-year-old autistic man. He does nothing but rock in his easy chair while gorging on an unending stream of snacks and sugar and vegging on his tablet. He refuses to leave the house or do anything useful, and the whole time he stays at home he is incredibly abusive, tearing into everyone and everything around him, particularly my mother who he has under his thumb. He gets everything he wants, and refuses to do so much as wipe his own ass, which he makes my 65-year-old father do for him. As we are legally unable to punish him for ANYTHING, giving him everything he wants is the only way to keep peace in our home. I am scared that when my aging parents die, I will be forced to take care of him for the rest of my life.

So where do other autistic adults go? I'm sure that other families don't put up with this. And I'm worried that no home will take him since he won't so much as take a dump without someone to service him. So what happens to autistic adults when they grow up and their families can't take care of them anymore?",0

My first impulse would be to call 911, but is it REALLY an emergency?...would it be better to call the non-emergency line?

(By the way, this is totally a hypothetical haha, I'm not standing over my friend's body like, ""hey Reddit, what should I do?"")


Edit- Thanks for the answers, everyone! Most people have said to call 911/999, but there's still a considerable number of answers that said the non-emergency number is the way to go (which is why I had the question in the first place). I will call 911 if it happens (and probably would have anyway to be honest) but I still don't consider it an ""emergency"" per se. Will a fast response time save someone who's already dead? And no, I can't legally determine that but I'm sure there are lots of situations where it's pretty obvious.

"Help settle a very, very silly argument with my wife: what is the left side of a bed? Take a look at [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/wXC1s). In your opinion, what side of the bed are the shoes on? The left or right?

**Her argument:** The left. I'm going to do my best to summarise her position but if anyone agrees with her, please feel free to bolster her case. Her view is that the sides of a bed should be viewed from the foot of the bed. If you told her to move to the left side of the bed she would move to where the shoes are. She would say that a person who sleeps on that side ""sleeps on the left"". In her favour, I believe that many hotel workers refer to the shoe side as the left side of the bed. I would argue that is informed by their relationship to the bed as a wholly external rather than functional one.

**My argument:** The right. Like a car, a bed really only has one functional purpose (well, more than one but you follow my meaning) and therefore the perspective of the bed's occupant is paramount in determining what is the left and right. In America there would be no argument over whether a driver sits on the left or right side of a car. The perspective of the external viewer standing at the hood is irrelevant. Imagine a single bed for a moment. Under my wife's paradigm we could have the absurd situation where, when lying on my back, the left side of my body is on the right side of the bed. Furthermore, this would not even be up for debate if we were considering a sofa.  She counters that, as beds are normally against a wall while sofas are more able to be ""freestanding"", this alters the consideration.

This might be the dumbest thing you've ever read but friends we've asked have come down about 50/50 on the matter. So, help us out, what is the left side of the bed?

*edit #1: tally so far; shoes are on the:
LEFT SIDE OF THE BED = 151;
RIGHT SIDE OF THE BED = 190;
OTHER (left or right depends on the viewer's location) = 76; Whatever your wife says = 25*

*edit #2: because I'm sorta getting my butt kicked here I'm pulling up this point from the comments - in the case of [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/4gjPT) would you say the woman is sitting on the left side or right side of the sofa? If the sofa was also a fold-out bed, would transitioning it into a bed flip what constitutes the right and left sides?*

*edit #3: ""Right side of the bed"" has pulled marginally ahead but ""whatever your wife says"" is coming up strong on the inside.*

*edit #4: With a sample size of nearly 450 people the results currently stand at -*

* 34% say the shoes are on the LEFT side of the bed
* 43% say the shoes are on the RIGHT side of the bed
* 17% say the location of the shoes are dependent on the viewer's perspective
* 6% say I should just shut up and agree with my wife

*A reasonable lead for rightsiders but certainly not enough to gloat about, unfortunately.*

*Also, for those concerned about the state of our marriage: we have these sort of dumb, good-spirited debates all the time. If we were to get divorced it would be over something far more serious like whether it is better to put clean clothes on a dirty body or dirty clothes on a clean body.*",0

Edit: thanks to all the responses. I can’t reply to everyone but I don’t think I have any preexisting conditions that affect my pee patterns or whatever. The long release after sleeping was just an example, but from the responses I believe it is just that sometimes the bladder can become irritated due to dehydration or a higher concentration of toxins that need filtering.

"How do I convince my parents to let me play video games? My parents are incredibly strict with my schedule. I've never been allowed to use the computer for anything more than school work (typing this at school), I have to study for like 13 hours in a day to keep them happy with my grades (I get yelled at for not making the straight A's in any exam), I'm forced to engage in sports I have no interest in during my downtime because Dad was an accomplished athlete and wants me to follow in his footsteps or whatever and I get like less than an hour in a day to watch something on tv. Video games are just so foreign a concept to them and they think it's an utter waste of time. They honestly reacted like I asked them for a gun or something when I first raised the topic with them. Is there any hope left for me or do I just have to live without video games for years until I move out?

EDIT: Thank you for the responses everyone.  Please accept my apologies for the late update, I was rather preoccupied with my usual schedule. To answer some commonly asked questions, I am a  14-year old high-schooler and I am indeed Asian. My parents care deeply for my well-being and see to it that I get all my needs met but they evidently have a fixed path for me in life and want me to live up to their expectations. I am sometimes disappointed with myself for not turning up to be the kid they wanted me to be, but I realize my interests in life will have to take precedent at some point. Some great points have been raised here on deliberating with them! Thank you once again for the insight reddit!",0

"I called the police. Might have overreacted... So I’m heading from a small community to a larger town that’s roughly 20 miles away. I set my cruise at 65 mph (approx 100 kmph) and just hang in my lane. I drive a large truck so I am not hotroding around... anyway... I large pickup passes me as if I’m sitting still. I notice it is a woman and she seemed agitated at something (me?). She slows down to the point that I have to get in the other lane (4 lane highway so effectively 2 lanes going my direction). As I approach her I notice she is jamming out, texting, and has what appears to be a 5-8 month old child...in the front seat. She then notices me and speeds up so that I don’t pass her. I’m like “cool. Ok, be crazy. I don’t care.” So the remainder of the trip I’m following her. She continues to speed up/slow down and randomly change lanes and other wise drive erratically. So for the safety of myself, other drivers and most importantly that poor infant I called the police. I gave the friendly dispatcher the make, model, color and license plate info of the truck and she said they would send a unit out to investigate. Do you think I over reacted? My community is plagued by drugs and the erratic behavior screamed drugs or alcohol. I call the police for legitimate stuff but I couldn’t shake the feeling something was wrong.

"I was accused of rape in college. I didn't do it, the DA never charged me, and the Title IX investigation went in my favor. How the fuck do I ever tell anybody about this? Sorry if this isn't the best place to post but everywhere else I could think to ask this question has deleted it for violating subreddit rules, so I hope this explains the complete lack of a support system I have for something like this.

I'll keep it brief. A few years ago I was accused of rape by a girl who hit me up on Tinder, came over on her own recognizance, and then accused me of raping her. I didn't do it and was cleared after an arduous 5 month process by both the local DA and the school. This wrecked me financially, emotionally, and physically as I put on 40 pounds during the ordeal.

It's a few years later and I'm still not over it. I wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks and I get an overwhelming sense of dread at random, inopportune moments and I have found it hard to form subsequent relationships. I didn't have sex for 2 years and I have found myself pushing away anyone who tries to get close to me intimately away

Perhaps the hardest thing is that I have absolutely no one to talk to about this. My parents know and they've done all they can to help but they were right there in the middle of it with me. My old roommate, who I told in case the police raided our room, has essentially ghosted me. All of my friends from school in my current city are ardently anti-sexual assault (as they should be) but they are the type of people who will always believe the victim no matter what which is making my anxiety much, much worse. All the moreso because my accuser is graduating this year and has apparently been telling people she was assaulted (even though the school's outside investigator thoroughly disagreed with her based on eyewitness accounts of her friends and her actions that night). It is absolute hell to be close to so many people and not be able to tell them about the pain I'm going through. 

As such, I'm alone. I work full-time and finding a counselor in my city is a near impossible task. I don't even know where to start with someone I feel comfortable with. More importantly. I fear I will be alone for the rest of my life. If I ever get close to any girl and tell her what happened to me, she'll run in the other direction. I don't even have a copy of the school's final report because they refused to hand over a copy; I had to read it in the office with a security guard watching me. I'm just so fucking tired of it. My life is slowly rotting from the inside and there's nothing I can do about it how do I fix it.

edit: thank you all for your replies it's meant so much to me. to clarify, I'm not looking to get into a pissing match with m y accuser because 1. I was never formally charged/had my name dragged through the mud and 2. I want to bury this incident as much as possible. The only thing I want is to get over my issues and get the final report from my school so I can have an objective piece of evidence to point to which I've gotten some great advice for already so thank you all again. 

to the people PMing me about their own stories of false accusations, my heart goes out to you as well. I don't have much advice to give since I'm still dealing with it myself but I'm with you every step of the way as well. 

also I AM NOT LONGER IN COLLEGE ANYMORE. I was a senior when this happened which also led to a lot of the stress because my school would have automatically expelled me had the outside investigator found in my accuser's favor. ",0
"How do I bathe my 8 month old daughter? I'm a new mom, never had plans on having kids, but it happened. I married the dad (by choice, he's my best friend), and we have a beautiful family, and his two older (12 &amp; 9) daughters are a huge help. 
But honestly, I don't know how to bathe her. 
I normally plop her in the tub, after I filled it up, put some toys in it, and let her splash around for awhile. She LOVES bath time. But how do I wash her? How do I wash her privates?

"Why are drugs illegal? I'm sorry, I know this is dumb.

I just can't wrap my head around why some substances are illegal, while others (alcohol, nicotine, caffeine) aren't. This doesn't come from someone who doesn't want to understand and only wants to do drugs without facing consequence, I just can't wrap my head around why for example alcohol is legal while, say, LSD isn't. 

The general answer I get is ""they're dangerous"" or ""they make people addicted"". So does alcohol. Guns are widely legal in most places with a permit, and they're also dangerous? Cars are also dangerous? Being ""dangerous"" doesn't seem to be a problem. ""It kills people"" so does alcohol and tobacco??? 

I'm not trying to argue, and I'm undecided on if I think it should be legal or not, I'm just trying to understand.

"My girlfriend put on some weight. How do I talk to her about it tactfully? I've been seeing her for a year and a half. When I met her she was 190, which was a little heavy but she still looked great. 

Fast forward to now and she is 220 and gaining. She's had family members even ask her if she's gained weight and it really hurt her feelings so I don't want to say anything hurtful. But to be honest I do find her less attractive and moreover I am concerned it is not stopping at 220 but will continue on.

I feel she is ""letting herself go"", she eats a lot of junk food. Sometimes for lunch all she will eat is a whole bag of candy. She drinks soda heavily, which I encourage her to cut down on but she doesn't want to.

 I've said a few times in a respectful way that maybe ""we"" should try to lose weight  (even though I am not overweight, Ive read this is the most tactful way to tell a partner they should try). When I say this she is insistent she doesn't need to lose weight.

I know I can't force her. I am just concerned with her eating habits and her complete unwillingness to admit she has a weight problem that she will only keep putting on the weight.

"Am I supposed to go along with the ""fake"" reason I'm being bootycalled for? Hi there,

Some girl I've been ""flirting"" with just asked me through facebook to come to her place and make her pancakes. 

It was a casual ""flirty"" conversation about crepes and pancakes that ended with that question.

I've heard through a mutual friend that she just broke up with her boyfriend. Oh and by the way she invited me to a party where she will be the only person a I know. At her place. So.

My question is really stupid but... if she calls me to ask me to come to her place... let's say... tommorow. Am I exptected to bring flour, eggs and shit to make pancakes? Or is it pretentious to go there with nothing? 

What do you think?

EDIT : SHE ASKED ME TO COME OVER TONIGHT. I NEED QUICK ANSWERS.

CRITICAL UPDATE : 

Guys wait, I'm back already. I have been scammed.

It was an actual pancake party.

I got to her frontdoor, ready to knock, when I noticed noise in the background. I thought to myself that it was the wrong place but no. ""app. 122, 9th floor"". I knocked.

She opens the door (she's really hot) and welcome me with a joint (nice). As I take a puff on it, she leads me to the living room.

5 peoples sitting around a table, with pancakes, alcohol, weed and stuffs. I dont know a single one of them. I say '""hi"" to everyone then take a sit. She sits right next to me, and instantly starts to flirt with me in front of those people.

As she puts her hand one my thigh, I realized I smoked weed and I also remember that I'm not a social smoker. Like, I smoke weed when alone or with friends and I'm good, but around people I dont know + a hot girl I'd like to fuck, I get paranoid and really anxious.

I realize that this was not what I signed for and that it was fair for me to awkwardly get the fuck out of here.

At this moment, one of her friend tells her ""randomfriend1 and randomfriend2 are on the way"" to which she respond with ""Oh ok, are randomfriend3 and randomfriend4 still coming?"" ""yeah!""

She then asked me if I wanted to go to the club with them (something like ~10 people I have never seen in my life). I told them no, and that I just meant to drop by, nothing more.

I'm home now. Dont worry I'm safe.

IMPORTANT EDIT : 

Hey guys, y'all need to chill.

I didnt blow anything or missed any opportunities. I absolutely dont want to date this girl. I barely know her and she just broke up with her boyfriend of 2-3 years and I dont want to date her or be her rebound or anything.

I thought that this was a booty call and since she is hot I was down for it. I was not down to attend a pancake party + nightclub with a group of people i dont know. On a fucking monday night. For a girl I dont give a damn about.

I was perfectly aware that she was flirting with me, thanks. I'm a little bit socially awkward but I'm not a robot. 

If she asks, I plan on being honest with her and tell her the truth even if that makes me sound like a loser. If she wants more than just casual sex I'm out. I dont need to meet her friends or attend her pancakes parties (unless if by ""pancakes"" she mean ""~~my~~ her butt"" and by ""party"" she mean ""just the two of us"")*

Now everyone is yelling at me that I'm a nerd for not dating her. 

So I'm tired to explain myself, it was fun while it lasted, I'm out.

TL;DR : Thought I was invited to some ""pancakes &amp; chill"" but got bamboozled into an actual pancake party. I got awkward and left. 

8 months later update for those who landed on this thread by accident : We were drunk as fuck at a party last week and she told me that it was indeed a booty call, but she was as awkward as me so she threw this whole pancake party at the last minute to get me to come thinking it would only last like half an hour. She called her friend to come, and that friend came and invited other friends, etc etc. 

It got out of her control and she perfectly understood why I left. After that she felt too awkward to pursue me again. I told her that she could pursue me now ... but she now has a new boyfriend.",0

"How can I best take care of my girlfriend after she has been sexually assaulted? Hey reddit,

I am currently about 3,000 miles away and recently learned that my girlfriend was sexually assaulted by someone in our college. It has been about a week and she woke up with bruises and there was barbiturates found in her system. Aside from wanting a name and wanting to slowly murder the kid (which I am not doing and putting my own feelings aside), I have been trying to talk to her and comfort her. She is going through a lot of pain and in her own words ""doesn't know how to talk about life and feels constantly tired and doesnt want to even begin taking steps to make things right because she cant, saying her heart is heavy."" I love this girl to death and I will not be back until December 1 but I want to know what there is that I can do to make her feel a bit better or at least know that I am there for her. 

Edit 1: Thank you everyone for all of the kind words, the support and the advice. As much as it pains and angers me to read the things that can and may happen to my SO as a result of this animalistic act, I am happy to know that I have you guys as both support and that I have also now been given hope of a light at the end of the tunnel.",0

"My mom babies me too much. How should I learn to be independent? I'm 24 and and I still live with my mom despite already having a job for the past 2 years. I live with her not because I can't afford a new home but because mom wants me around and she said she feels lonely and depressed without me. She loves to cuddle, hug and kiss me every time she sees me and she cooks really great food, cleans the dishes, sweeps, mops, does my laundry etc, and doesn't allow me to help her with it because she thinks I'm a young child. I love her to bits and I enjoy cuddling with her but I feel like I'm old enough not to depend so much on her. How should I tell my mom that she should stop babying me so much without hurting her feelings? 

Edit: Thanks for the responses everyone! Can't say I expected so many upvotes or responses for what I thought is a very stupid and banal question. Some great tips have been raised here on convincing my mom not to baby me so much.  I'll probably go on some longer trips and get her a cuddly pet soon! Also to the people who were concerned about mom using me, I can reassure you that she doesn't have a mental disorder or something as has been suggested by some.  She genuinely loves me as her child and wants the best for me in life! I love her immensely too and I will never cut her off from my life for as long as I have her. The blame shouldn't squarely lie on her as I am at fault too for indulging her! Hopefully we get over this babying thing soon and with no hard feelings so that we can have a really great relationship!",0

"My son's school is doing ""emotional intelligence""...is this whole thing crazy or am I emotionally dysfunctional? If you have never heard of it, there's this project called RULER: http://ei.yale.edu/ruler/

The acronym stands for recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing, and regulating emotions.

That all sounds fine and good; I absolutely think all adults in this world should be able to do those things. The problem I have is in the way this thing actually functions. Last week they made an emotional ""charter"" -- which as far as I can tell is a document that tells you how everyone should feel. For example it says ""we will display a contagious positive energy""

Now this is the part that makes me feel crazy. How can you possibly agree how to feel each day? I myself only rarely have such an ""energy"" -- how could I make myself feel that way every day? Would I even want to make myself feel that way every day? I've known some people in my life that forced themselves to be high energy and positive all the time; turns out they were just suppressing their negative thoughts and eventually it caught up with them.

"Is it possible for my best friend to bequeath his skull to me upon his death? My close friend of decades was recently hospitalized for heart concerns.  The surgeon suggested the only through his malady was heart bypass surgery.  This information hit him pretty hard and I realized I would  miss him if he were gone.  Being the sentimental type I am, I asked in the event of  his passing if I could have his skull as a keepsake?  He thought about it a bit and agreed that would be just fine. 

I know this is possible.  I recently had my gall bladder removed and the surgeon shoved it in a jar for me and it now sits at home on a bookshelf. 

This is a serious question, yet I have no idea how one would go about this.  He is in the state of California and is married.  He has not brought this up to his wife, yet I am certain she would abide by his last wishes.  

Good news is he had the procedure and is fine.  The bad news is we suspect he may die in the future and do not know  how (if it is even) it is possible to go about this the next go around.

Yes, we have discussed the possibility that I could shuffle off this mortal coil before him and to date he has not expressed an interest in having my skull adorn his keepsake shelf. 

Lastly, I don't imagine someone is just going to remove his skull and hand it to me  in a patients belonging bag.  I suspect it would have to be denuded and fed to critters to clean the skull.  Money is not an issue although I don't want to sell my house to pay for the project.

"My little brother is around 5’3” and weighs 250+ lbs. He is only 10-years-old. My mom doesn’t care about his weight. Who should I tell to help him? Hello, there. I tried googling this question and nothing came up, so I’m posting. 

My younger brother is a heavy boy. He breathes loud, he has stretch marks all over his body, he gets tired easily. 

All he does is play watch YouTube videos, play no game other than Fortnite and eat when he comes home. He does homework at the end of the day, so he isn’t entirely slacking off in school, but his educational performance isn’t very great or good. Decent, at best. But that’s another topic. I am much more concerned with his health. I am his older sister, 20-years-old, and when I was younger I would try to help him. I took him to play soccer when he was interested in it and tried not to feed him too much of anything and try to stay away from those greasy foods and junk food. I started losing weight myself, I was 225 lbs at my highest and have lost a lot of weight since. 

But I couldn’t do it anymore. I picked up two jobs and started going to college. I would still tell him to not eat junk food and my parents not to feed him bad things, but my mom didn’t like that I would neglect him anything like chips or soda. She doesn’t care! I tell her he will die and she’s like “it’s his fault”. She is neglectful to my brother. My father says he will put him in a gym once he’s 13, but what if he doesn’t even make it till 13? He will be 11 in August, he can gain even more weight, get a stroke, a heart attack, anything until 2.5 years from now.  

Is there anyone I can tell? I don’t know what to do. If I try to put him into a sport or something it doesn’t work. I just told my mother I want to take him to the park, so he can exercise and she said “no, he doesn’t want to do that”. Like??? You are the mother, he doesn’t have the final say.

"Likely to fail drug test. Should I resign or tell employer I will fail the test? So basically, I got a package offer for employment with my current employer before my 90 days probation period was up. I was already working for them, but through a temp-agency that they had told me to go apply.

The problem I'm currently facing is that I smoked pot and ate edibles pretty heavily around the 1st or 2nd week of December. My employer's HR is coming to my office to tell me, I need to get my drug testing completed at a lab down the street, and honestly, I haven't had the time, so it's been pushed till today.

Last night I bought a Marijuana test kit from CVS and tested this morning, which unfortunately showed positive. 

Now I'm contemplating over whether or not to quit on my terms and tell them the package honestly wasn't appealing, or simply tell the HR I will probably fail the test and I don't see the point of going to the lab

I want to be honest with the HR and keep it off record by just communicating to them verbally, without going to take the test I will inevitably fail. Is this worth it? Can my current employer tell any future employer about my disclosure?  

I obviously don't plan to take the drug test, so there's really only two options for me. I'm also assuming, no matter how much they may like me and need me at the moment, since it is the biggest glazing company in the US, they probably have a zero-tolerance policy. 

Which direction should I take?


**UPDATE:** So I took the test yesterday after work...let's see what HR says, cause the lab person said they will send an email for the results right after I was done. Oh, and the HR told me that if my test comes out diluted, it's automatically considered a positive result, so...I guess they are pretty damn strict here. Oh well.

**Additionally, thanks for all the responses, whether some were for shits and giggles.**

**UPDATE 2:** Not sure what's going on, but they told me to bring the USB with all the benefits information. I'm not sure if they got the results, or they haven't got the results...Maybe I'll know on Monday ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**UPDATE 3:** I guess I got the job. HR didn't bring up anything about testing positive. I feel like chugging 5 bottles of water 3-4hours prior to drug test did me good. Thanks everyone. I actually took advice from here and now I know there's no point saying anything, unless it's brought up!",0

It's happened in everything from Terminator 2 to Breaking Bad (and obviously a shit load of others). Are people satisfied by these type of endings even though they happen so often? Do writers not know another way to make things dramatic and exciting? Is this situation actually realistic?

How do I sell my socks online? (27F) Hi I have heard that people online would buy worn socks due to having a feet fetish.

"Tell me about tone of voice in tonal languages I'm a native English speaker. If someone is confused, angry, etc - it's pretty obvious in their tone of voice. 

In certain languages such as Mandarin, a word's meaning is determined by its tone, meaning an upward or downward inflection would change one word to another, completely unrelated word. 

Is it still easy to deterimne mode by one's tone of voice in a tonal language? If not, do the tones of voice have a subtle impact on the speaker's emotional state? For example, if the Jing in Beijing has a rising tone at the end, does it subtly give people a positive mental association with the city, as it mimics what would sound like an excited tone in English?",0

"Can you deliberately obfuscate information in legal documents while still providing enough information to recover it? There's a pretty well discussed dark pattern where signing up for a subscription online is made very easy, but cancelling it requires you to either mail something or make a phone call. Often, that information can be pretty well hidden, as Last Week Tonight discussed in their episode on robocalls where they mentioned that some companies bury the opt-out method in their terms of serivce. 

That got me wondering how extreme a bad actor could carry that. If your street address was PO Box 451 could you describe that by a lyric poem that references Fahrenheit 451?

Let’s pretend for a moment that global warming is a hoax, and burning fossil fuels isn’t bad for the environment. If we have two options, and if we simply disregard the health and environmental impacts, we have one that depletes resources, and one that doesn’t. Why would we choose the one that depletes resources? If it is simply because those companies won’t make money, I just don’t get it. There have been plenty of major companies that tanked because they didn’t modernize and adapt. Look at blockbuster- they were positioned at the top of their game and because they didn’t want to adapt to people’s changing lifestyles and value of convenience, they went under. I also understand that there are a lot of jobs in that sector, but imagine if you’re a fossil fuel company and you’re the first one of the bunch to invest in renewable energies, and train those employees to be able to work at your renewable energy company. It would be a lot of money up front, but if you were to do it and do it well, you’d be in a position to make so much more money!! It would be like the first people building railroads across North America. Adapt to a changing need of the people, be the first do do it and do a good job and you’d be making so much more money than they could ever hope to by influencing politics and policy.

"Why hasn’t a cell phone company allowed porn apps in its store. Wouldn’t that make them the most popular phone provider in the world? I remember reading long ago that porn drives media technology and the reason DVD’s went mainstream over other types digital media in the 90’s is because the porn industry decided to use DVD’s. Porn also played a huge and early role in internet streaming and now VR. 

This leads me to believe that any phone company with good smart phones that offers porn apps in their App Store would gain a huge market share if not be the top selling phone in the world. I know porno sites have worked very hard on making their websites mobile user friendly but apps are always preferred on phones and tend to work better. AR, VR, wireless sex toy technology, etc. is growing and the market base for porn is constantly expanding but the major phone providers and platforms are completely ignoring these huge revenue sources. 

The market for a quality phone with access to pornographic apps is massive and wide open. When demand for a product is that high companies usually fight over the customer base but I’ve never heard of any company offering porn apps. Any idea why nobody is cashing in on that gravy train?",0

"Why is it considered socially unacceptable to wear sweat pants in public? X-Post from r/eli5 

Over the past few days, I've read a couple posts on Reddit and some articles about how sweat pants are considered indoor clothing and shouldn't be worn in public.

I have always hated jeans and as a result always worn sweatpants for their convenience and comfort, and the general perception of this issue literally baffles me - I truly cannot comprehend it. As a result, I have a couple of questions regarding the specific arguments brought up around sweatpants that I want to ask.

1.	People suggest that wearing sweatpants in public makes you look like a slob, and some say that they judge people for it. Outside of a professional setting or unless they are wearing literal rags, it has never, not once in my life, occurred to me to observe, let alone judge, what other people are wearing. Is this a common thing that people do? It strikes me as incredibly odd and pointless.

2.	Some comments suggest that sweatpants suggest laziness, as if the wearer has ""given up"" on their appearance and is prioritizing their comfort over their presentation. What is the logic in deliberately making yourself uncomfortable to be more presentable? Is the difficulty of putting on clothes and the time you spend putting them on them directly tied to your ""presentability?""

3.	How do most people pick up prevailing fashion trends? Until very recently, I never even knew there existed a stigma against sweat pants because it was never mentioned to me. Are people expected to recognize socially acceptable streetwear by osmosis? if so, does that suggest that most people spend time observing and copying what others wear?

4.	Some commentators connected the ""bagginess"" of sweatpants to sloppiness. Is there any inherent/rational connection between these two concepts or is something else that most people just intuitively ""get""?",0

"Why does it seem that PTSD is observed more frequently today than in much worse wars of the past? I don’t mean for this question to be incendiary. I’m really just curious. I’ve scoured the internet and struggled to find more than a couple of reports of WW2 soldiers presenting with symptoms of PTSD. Of course PTSD was not diagnosed in the 40s and 50s, but I would have thought that since WW2 was filled with WAY more violence, atrocities, and heinous war crimes than Korea, Vietnam, or either of the Iraq wars (probably combined) that PTSD would be rife among the surviving allied and axis soldiers. But as far as I can find, there aren’t very many reports of those soldiers struggling with PTSD-like symptoms. I have to imagine that the front-line soldier then saw, experienced, or maybe even acted in much more horrific acts of war than soldiers in more recent wars. Is something different with the wars of today? Why does it seem like PTSD is way, way, way more common in today’s soldier than in soldiers throughout history? Thanks.",0

There are lots of things that exist but are too tiny for the human eye to see (like microbes) without using some magnifying device. So if, say, you have a piece of paper, and you start cutting it in half, can you cut it enough times that the remainder is too tiny for you to see (if not achievable due to practical reasons, then could it at least be done theoretically)? 

So that the piece of paper eventually disappears from sight?",0

"Has anyone seen a UFO?  Edit - I am not arguing aliens, or the definition of UFOs. Just wondering if others have seen things like this. 

 I know this is a ridiculous question. Back thirteen years or more years ago. My friend was driving me home from his place when I asked him to stop the car, and if he saw this strange light that seemed like it was floating. 
 
 Well, he stopped immediately and we both looked out his windshield.  I told him to turn off the car since we couldn't hear it. I was thinking it was a helicopter or a plane.
 
 Both of us could see the silhouette against the night sky as well, but it was mainly the lights we saw. Three in a triangle shape. 

 So we get out of the car after 15 seconds after I asked him to stop, and the thing still has not moved at all. It's even hovering above us - but you cannot hear it. So it was either massive and high, or quiet and low. 
 
 We can see the silhouette against a dark night we are freaking out why we can't hear it. Everyone near airfields or military basis knows how loud craft are. Also, this thing wasn't moving. 

 I kept saying it must be some new helicopter, because it has hardly moved. I also saw a red reflective light in the center. Kind of like looking at an old infrared camera. 
 
 Anyways that's when the craft started moving from a standstill, and within ten seconds sped up to insane speeds and left to the east. There is absolutely no way a helicopter does that. 

 My friend believed it was an alien aircraft. I believe it was a prototype or some military project, since I don't believe in aliens visiting like that.

"Why does milk from the supermarket sometimes taste weirdly bitter and chemical-y? A few months ago all the milk from a certain local store suddenly tasted disgusting or off no matter what brand, but not like it was sour. It wasn't curdled nor did it smell spoiled at all, the taste ranged from being kind of like the milk left over after eating a bowl of cheerios to an intensely bitter feeling that legitimately made my throat burn. I switched to another store and their milk is usually fine, but every so often they have the issue too for a week or so before returning to normal.

I thought it might be seasonal if the cows are eating something different, but i've had the issue at least once in winter, spring, and summer and presumably all the processing removes those flavour variations anyway. It's not just me either, my girlfriend can taste the difference too.

What could cause milk to taste so bad seemingly at random? If it's something happening before the milk reaches store shelves, how can I report the issue?",0

"Is food addiction legit? I'm really not sure what sub this should be on so if anyone has any other suggestions please let me know.

I had a debate with my Dad lately (for reference I am 19 and my father is 71) about food addiction, I love my Dad with all my heart but some of his opinions are kind of 'non PC' I guess due to him being raised in a non PC era. We got onto the subject of fat people (I don't remember how) and I basically said that I have a fair amount of sympathy for people who are morbidly obese because the chances are that they are suffering from a food addiction possibly due to childhood trauma or mental health issues and that I view it as no different to someone suffering from alcoholism or a drug addiction.

My father's viewpoint is essentially that food (as well as gambling) addiction is not really a thing because it's not an addiction to a chemical it is a psychological addiction, whereas a drug addiction is a physical addiction (due to withdrawal symptoms etc.) as well as a psychological addiction which makes it significantly harder to overcome. I told him that there are also all sorts of chemicals in fast food such as MSG but he said that it is regulated whereas chemicals in recreational drugs are not. 

The debate eventually ended because we agreed that neither of us really know about it for certain because we haven't did the research so we were arguing based on assumptions. But still I feel like gambling and food addictions are legit.

"Something I can do with my left hand but not my right Okay so, this is something that has to do with the human body I suppose. But it doesn't affect my health. I've know about it for years but there is no way to show it so I'll just explain. (So it's not medical advice but I don't know of a good sub reddit at the moment so I will ask here) And it's not something I can Google easily either.

&amp;#x200B;

There's not really a good way of explaining this so I'll just explain it the best I can.

  
Ever since I was kid, there's a thing I can do with my left hand. And it's literally just the hand, not the arm. And it feels more like it happens on my palm and fingers than the outside of the hand.

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard of people being able to manually control the heat of their hand just by will power alone so I think it's somewhere along that line minus the heating part. Nothing happens. I don't sweat or anything unsual.

&amp;#x200B;

If I focus and concentrate, I begin to feel something in my hand. But I have to think about it, stop whatever I am doing and focus. It feels like it goes around my fingers, and it is moving but again, just in my palm and fingers. Almost like a shape is forming and it constantly shifts like wet clay. If I let it go long enough, it even feels like the texture of a the side of a coin minus the metal part. More like ridges at times. I only feel the same stuff and it changes.

&amp;#x200B;

It's strange because I know I am feeling something but there's nothing there and I am not really feeling anything. And I can only do it with my left. I have an identical twin and they have told me they can do it too.

&amp;#x200B;

Visually nothing happens to my hand. And I can't do it with any other part of the body. It doesn't hurt or anything either.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just never known what it is or what I am doing. It's the strangest thing I've never been able to find out. There's no way to prove what I am saying is true either because nothing happens on my hand that anyone can see.

&amp;#x200B;

Guess I am just really curious as to what is though.",0

"Taking a puppy on a road trip Hi Guys!

We just got our puppy! She's a 8 weeks old German Shorthaired Pointer.

She's adorable and we love her incredibly much. She healthy and already had her first shot.

We only have her in our flat and train her with fake grass and peepee-pads because we have a lot of dogs in our neighborhood and we don't want her to catch something from an unvaccinated dog.

Now we have planned a road trip (before we got the puppy) with friends and I'm kind of panicking about taking her with us. We don't really want to leave her with somebody else, because she's getting used to us. Do you think it will be ok to bring her with us? She'll be 11 weeks and will have her second shot till then. We'll be in the car a lot (she doesn't have a problem with that) and we'll carry her around a lot. We'll make sure she won't meet any other dogs.

Do you think that it will ok?

Or do you think that we will endanger her?

Thank you so much for your respond!

"Anyone here have an iPhone XR？ So I recently got my phone replaced through warranty but now I noticed that the battery seems to be draining a LOT faster than the old one

"In English, why is the letter “w” pronounced “double-u” but the letter “m” isn’t pronounced “double-n”? So I was discussing potentially stupid questions with my friend and this was one of them.... now I’m actually curious if there is a reason. 

In terms of letter structure, it seems to make more sense that “m” should be pronounced “double-n”. When comparing the lower case letters, “w” and “m”, you will notice that the “m” has a vertical line on the left hand side, which more closely resembles two letter “n”s. Comparatively, the letter “w” does not have a vertical line on the right hand side so it doesn’t really look like two “u”s at all.

I am also wondering if other languages follow the same structure of pronunciation for these letters “w” and “m”.

P.S. would it be stupid to ask if we should change the letters “n” and “m” to “half-m” and “half-w”, respectively? 

P.P.S is there a subreddit to ask intentionally stupid questions?

For example, I typically call depression a mental illness in conversation because (speaking for myself) I've beaten it. It was like i was sick for many years, but i am no longer sick. I saw doctors and took medication, and have recovered. Its also a sickness that can be deadly and sometimes kills people, so illness seems to fit.

However, I also live with an anxiety disorder? I see doctors and take medication for that too, but calling it an ""illness"" seems odd to me for some reason and i cant put my finger on why. 

Why would or wouldn't you call something an illness versus a disorder? it seems to be coin flip as to which term they fall under or cross over with.

My landlord had a plumber in to make and adjustment on the bath tub and I ran the water level by him, he said it's ""just one of those stupid low flow toilets, I hate them because of the skid marks.""

"Well, I'm in orlando Hi guys, I don't know how to ask my question properly so I'm gonna try to put you in context.
I'm a Canadian and I got to Orlando FL for the first time. It was the first time I boarded a plane and everything and I'm here for a class related to work.
People back home get there all the time for vacations and say it's amazing but I idon't see how. 
I mean there is palm trees and everything but past that I can't help myself but think that, it's just another city. There's just a f***** pool full of kids and a parking lot. 
Everywhere it's just stores and restaurants. I tried to ask locals but they tell me to go to Disneyland and I don't have that much money and idk, I fell like it's just going to be   a money pit amusement park.

"When an item is being marketed towards women, and it has a taste or a scent, it's usually labeled something like ""Pina Colada"" or ""Peach Kiwi"". When a flavored/scented item is marketed to men, it's often labeled something along the lines of ""ANTIFREEZE VOLCANO COMBUSTION BLAST"". Why? Anything scented and geared towards women are often labeled something simple and obvious. Green apple shampoo. Lemon-lime perfume. Honey and almond moisturizer. 

Men's scented items are often titled something outrageous and in-your-face, without really telling you what it actually smells or tastes like. For example, there's an Axe body spray, and the scent is called ""Dark Temptation"". 

I also drink Bang, and one of the flavor is ""Black Cherry Vanilla"", or something like that. However, there's also a flavor called ""Star Blaster"". I know what cherries and vanilla taste like. I don't know what the fuck a star blaster tastes like.

I know things like women and men fragrances, and energy drinks, and all that are technically gender-neutral, and you can really use whatever you want on your body. But as far as items being geared towards certain genders, it's pretty obvious which scents are being marketed towards which genders when you go to, say, Walmart.",0

"Why is there often a 3-5 second period after a major power outage where power comes back on? About 500 yards from my home there is an awkward intersection which has frequent accidents.  A few times per year an accident is bad enough to knock the power out for a few hours.  The way I can usually tell that this is the case is that the power goes out and then maybe 20-30 seconds later it comes back on for 3-5 seconds and then goes back off.

Without fail, within 5 minutes there are tons of sirens outside.

I would think that when this happened, the power would be severed and even a brief surge of power would not be possible.  My only thought is perhaps there is some industrial capacitor or something that is discharging.

Any ideas?",0
"What exactly do people mean when they say a child cannot give consent? I know I’m getting into REALLY uncomfortable territory here, so I want to make one thing clear: I DO NOT CONDONE ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR WITH CHILDREN! With that being said, it is a bit weird when people say “a child cannot give consent.” I mean, sure, it would be a life ruining decision, but say if someone was around 11 and learned how sex worked (I remember starting masturbating when I was 10 and learning about it a year later) couldn’t they at least say “I want to have sex.” And wouldn’t that be giving consent?

This post will probably be deleted but I just want to know about this because when taken literally I don’t entirely understand it, but I don’t want you to get the wrong idea. If a kid said something like this it wouldn’t make it ok, but they have the mental capacity to give consent, whether that’s an ok thing to do or not.",0

"Why am I scared of looking at wrist injuries? I ask this as my teeth chatter, right after a dizzy spell from watching a scene in 'The Americans' when a couple come home to find their son has slit his wrists.

**CONTEXT**: I get dizzy seeing large quantities of my own blood, but not of anyone else. *However*, this question is specifically about watching blood on screen. I am big lover of the crime drama. Most of the classic mob movies, TV shows like The Sopranos, The Wire - you name it. It goes without saying that am not scared of looking at blood on screen, no matter what quantity. This is no exaggeration, as I have spent time watching videos on BestGore. I can watch someone's throat getting slit, decapitations, arms and legs getting chopped off, stabbings, etc. The most gory videos and scenes don't phase me at all.

*Except...* wrist injuries. I just cannot stand them. I can watch a person getting sliced with a blade across the chest or thigh, but so help me god if its a sliced wrist. I always get dizzy and almost pass out, just like when I go to the doctor for a blood test. Something about it just makes me squirm with unease, and then when I feel dizzy and sick I get on my bed and curl into a ball until it passes. It happened when I watched 'Heat', when the main detective comes home to find his daughter in the bathtub with her wrists open. It happened again when I watched '127 hours' when the guy has to slowly cut his arm off to free himself from the boulder (not exactly wrist it was close enough to get me dizzy), and it happened now. It's such a specific and odd thing to be afraid of. Even a **hand chopped clean off at the wrist** has no effect.

I did some research and came up with carpophobia, a fear of wrists. But this doesn't make sense, as the people who usually ask about it online are sometimes scared of looking, touching or bringing a sharp object near to their wrists. This is a bit extreme. I could look at my (intact) wrists all day long with no problem besides boredom. I can even touch it with a knife and there would be no problem. So I have doubts about this as well.",0

Edit: ""Don't run out and buy a new pair of glasses as soon as you notice you have blurred vision. It could just be a temporary problem that develops rapidly and is caused by high blood sugar levels.
High blood sugar causes the lens of the eye to swell, which changes your ability to see. To correct this kind of blurred vision, you need to get your blood sugar back into the target range. For many people this is from70 mg/dL to 130 mg/dL before meals and less than 180 mg/dL one to two hours after the start of a meal. Ask your doctor what your personal target range should be.""",0

1. Fire. It’s slow, painful, and you do not just immediately pass out from smoke inhalation. Odds of survival are there based on if someone rescues you and that means recovery is equally excruciating.

Your lungs begin to fill with water, within minutes you become unconscious. Survival is limited as it depends if anyone notices that you are drowning. Relatively peaceful death.

3. You fall from a cliff. Not a large cliff to clarify. So, no you will not just splatter instantly. Depending on your luck you could die relatively quickly or it could take days.

I have big dreams and want to live my life to it's fullest but am not taking the correct steps to get to where I want to be. Seeing that LPT on the front page about the uses of therapy started me thinking, and therapy would probably be hugely beneficial for me.

I don't have medical insurance for a number of reasons - I live in the Seattle area of WA state and my Obamacare premium went from free for my income bracket last year to ~$165/month for the same bracket. I can't afford that with my present financial situation.

My parents tell me I can't be on their insurance unless I'm enrolled in school. I recently got a puppy and decided to take a break from school, so that isn't an option at least until the Fall.

My work offers health benefits but only to full time workers - I'm part time and that isn't likely to change, I like the light schedule when I'm in school.

Do I have any options? Right now I'm just holding out for fall so I can get insurance through my parents. Feeling pretty helpless to help myself.

[Why UPS drivers don’t turn left and you probably shouldn’t either](https://theconversation.com/why-ups-drivers-dont-turn-left-and-you-probably-shouldnt-either-71432)

Excerpt:

&gt;UPS have designed their vehicle routing software to eliminate as many left-hand turns as possible (in countries with right-hand traffic). Typically, only 10% of the turns are left turns. As a result, the company claims it uses 10m gallons less fuel, emits 20,000 tonnes less carbon dioxide and delivers 350,000 more packages every year.

"How to get a girlfriend after years of dealing with anxiety that stopped me form even talking to girls? EDIT: Ugh, I messed up the title. It should say “How to get a girlfriend after a year of dealing with anxiety that stopped me from even taking to girls.

Before we start, this is my alt account in case anyone thinks I am spamming. I just didn’t want to post this on my main account.

Hi everyone,

Now this may seem as a stupid question (hence why I posted it on here), but I want to know how to get a girlfriend.

Some backstory (I am a male, age 19), back in high School I used to be outgoing, talkative, and able to talk to anyone.
After high school (about 1 year, at age 18). I had something traumatic happen to me and it caused me to suffer from anxiety after that event. From there, I could barely talk to anyone, especially girls. Now my anxiety has gotten a bit better and I am able to talk to girls with ease, as in, if I don’t have feelings for them, I can talk to them with ease (For the most part. I still am not able to talk them like I used to unless I get to know them for a while). But recently, I want to girlfriend. A lot of my friends either are talking to someone or have a girlfriend. Usually I wouldn’t care, but now I think it is time I get out there again.

Also, I am not the healthiest but have been trying to lose weight. Also, I am really rusty on trying to get a girlfriend.

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions or advice to get one. Anyone experience something similar to what I did or am and have any advice?
All advice is appreciated.",0

"Is it possible to permanently alter your dopamine levels through unhealthy behavior? Does age play a part in this? I’m 16, and don’t live the healthiest lifestyle. I eat a lot of junk food, masturbate multiple times daily, and for a 4 month span smoked a lot of weed (daily use). Although fit, I barely exercise and don’t have a job. Heavily addicted to nicotine.


I’ve since noticed a decline in overall happiness and realized I was slowly entered a world endured with depression. I’ve attributed these thoughts toward my excessive drain of dopamine I put my brain through as of recently. I’ve since quit smoking weed as a start, as I feel like it played the biggest part.

I lack the motivation to change the rest but hope to in the future.

A couple years from now however, I see myself fixing most of these things. 

It think it’s good I’ve came to the realization as atleast I have my teen years to fix this issue before I enter the real world and it’s responsibilities.

HOWEVER

I worry that even if I get my life turned around, that I’ve completely altered my dopamine levels and they will never resort to how they should be, leaving me with a more depressed, unmotivated lifestyle then most.

Is this the case? Is it too late for me?


Part of me understands that altering dopamine levels during development could rewire my brain but then the other of me wonders if my brain would, through time, re adapt. I mean, if it adapted to my unhealthy behavior getting me to where I am now, isnt it likely it will do the same once I become healthy?",0

It wasn't until my cousin started watching it for the first time and while we were watching it together I realized then I had far more.....emotion I guess?

"How do I report an Instagram user or his website for selling merch &amp; never actually sending the purchased items, and ignoring all requests for refunds? Long story short, I’ve followed a political account on Instagram for 7 years. The dude &amp; I have been e-buddies on Instagram ever since he only had a few followers.

He launched a merch line last year that’s actually pretty sick. It’s not like he scammed everyone, because he did actually ship out the merch people were buying. Since I’ve followed him for so long, he cut me a deal to buy one of his leather wallets with a skull on it for $45. I asked if he could hold it for me until I get paid (I just launched a business &amp; money is tight.) He said yes.

When I got paid, I shot him a DM and asked if he still had it. He said, “word is bond,” so I paid him over PayPal. Well, long story short, it’s been 3.5 months &amp; he never sent it, and he’s had a few excuses along the way, such as “PTSD issues” (he’s a veteran) &amp; the website messing up.

Now, he’s completely ignoring my messages, ignored my PayPal request for a refund, and ignores my comments when I comment on his posts asking that he respond to my DM. What do I do? I could REALLY use that $45 right now since I have $1.25 in my bank account &amp; I don’t get paid till the 15th.

TL;DR - Bought a wallet for $45 from a guy I’ve followed in Instagram for 7 years. Now he’s ignoring my messages &amp; never sent the wallet after nearly 4 months.

**EDIT - So with crazy coincidence (or perhaps not), he messaged me the shipping label with a tracking number within 30 minutes of this post. After 3.5 months of pressing. Interesting. Thank you all for your input.**",0

"In the movie Death To Smoochy, how and/or why is what Randolph does considered embezzlement? I double checked the previous post in r/askreddit that had essentially asked this and I was kind of hoping for a more in depth reason or answer for this. Thank you to the person who was also curious about this. Glad to know I'm not the only one.

I finally got around to rewatching Death To Smoochy, and I am curious how and/or why is what Randolph does considered embezzlement?

I thought embezzlement was one or more parties falsifying something or tricking a company in some way to where the company produces extra income or sends money to somewhere it shouldn't be.
I'll admit that is probably a very simple way of explaining one aspect of something that probably has multiple meanings and levels that probably have different ways to get violated that I am oblivious to.

Based off of what I think to be embezzlement I am having a hard time seeing it as anything other than an actor being gifted money for a service provided for a child or at most a bribe with some tax evasion sprinkled on top depending on how much money he's been receiving but even then what if he did somehow pay the taxes on the money recieved? 

I mean, there's probably a rule in place for shows like this where the host SHOULD pick a kid by random but is it enforced or is it treated more like meh, do what you want. If the former is true I could see how breaking that rule would get him in trouble but wouldn't the money from the parents to pick their kid be more like them paying him for his services as a performer or say they are just rich and happy that their kid got picked or what if that's like a secret gift to make the kid feel special for a lasting potentially cherished memory of when they got picked by their favorite kids show host or something like that.

Is there perhaps a clause in an actor's contract that basically says whatever you make is ours too if you do it as your character? In which case I could maybe see how that applies as embezzlement.

Is there a law in place that forbids the transfer of money between two individuals if it exceeds a certain amount if they are just regular Joe schmoes?

"I went to a tattoo studio for a design concept, but after 3 revisions, I am not happy with the outcome. What's the etiquette regarding this? I went to a tattoo studio that seemed to have done some good work and explained a concept that I had. It was based on a video game character but I wanted some changes in the way he stood, etc. I told them to take their time coming up with a design. They've been messaging me and after two revisions, I went there again to discuss the final refinements so that I wouldn't need to make more changes later. 

I didn't hear from them for a week after that (the previous drawings all came within 48 hours) and after messaging once and calling two days after that, I finally got another version that didn't have all the changes I had asked for. 

Now I'm beginning to lose faith in these guys and want to move on to someone else. What is the etiquette regarding this? Should I offer to pay for the time spent in their sketches? What's the best way to politely say I'm not comfortable with them putting a permanent mark on my skin?",0

"How do people lose the weight they gained after vacation, a holiday, etc. so quickly? So I was watching a few videos of a girl who decided to eat what she wanted in a day, and by the end she weighed herself, and then continued to weigh herself for the next few days.

"How to get into a girlfriend even though anxiety prevents me from getting one? Before we start, this is my alt account in case anyone thinks I am spamming. I just didn’t want to post this on my main account.

Hi everyone,

Now this may seem as a stupid question (hence why I posted it on here), but I want to know how to get a girlfriend.

Some backstory (I am a male), back in high School I used to be outgoing, talkative, and able to talk to anyone.
After high school (about 1 year). I had something traumatic happen to me and it caused me to suffer from anxiety after that event. From there, I could barely talk to anyone, especially girls. Now my anxiety has gotten a bit better and I am able to talk to girls with ease, as in, if I don’t have feelings for them, I can talk to them with ease (For the most part. I still am not able to talk them like I used to unless I get to know them for a while). But recently, I want to girlfriend. A lot of my friends either are talking to someone or have a girlfriend. Usually I wouldn’t care, but now I think it is time I get out there again.

Also, I am not the healthiest but have been trying to lose weight. Also, I am really rusty on trying to get a girlfriend.

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions or advice to get one. Anyone experience something similar to what I did or am and have any advice?
All advice is appreciated.",0

"Toilet roll debate - wife trolling me TL:DR at bottom.

So the wife and I had the talk.  Which way do you put the toilet roll on the holder.  I believe in the way that you wouldn’t have it if you had a cat, she doesn’t care.

It blew her mind when I told her I swap it if she makes the 50/50 chance decision of putting it on the wrong way. Since then she’s flipped the fucker on me 7 or 8 times. 

I haven’t told her but I know what she is up to now. I’ve even marked the inside of the roll to confirm she just doesn’t use a roll a day. 

I’m contemplating ways I can joke with her by knowing this information. Maybe I’ll let it run and just keep a count. See how high we get til she gets bored of it?
